1,Animal Friendship ,Enchantment/Charm,Animal,10 yds.,VSM,Permanent,1 hr.,1 animal,Neg.,By means of this spell; the caster is able to show any animal of animal intelligence to semi-intelligence (i.e.; Intelligence 1-4) that he desires friendship. If the animal does not roll a successful saving throw vs. spell immediately when the spell is begun; it stands quietly while the caster finishes the spell. Thereafter; it follows the caster about. The spell functions only if the caster actually wishes to be the animal's friend. If the caster has ulterior motives; the animal always senses them (for example; the caster intends to eat the animal; send it ahead to set off traps; etc.). The caster can teach the befriended animal three specific tricks or tasks for each point of Intelligence it possesses. Typical tasks are those taught to a dog or similar pet (i.e.; they cannot be complex). Training for each such trick must be done over a period of one week; and all must be done within three months of acquiring the creature. During the three-month period; the animal will not harm the caster; but if the creature is left alone for more than a week; it will revert to its natural state and act accordingly. The caster can use this spell to attract up to 2 Hit Dice of animal(s) per experience level he possesses. This is also the maximum total Hit Dice of the animals that can be attracted and trained at one time: no more than twice the caster's experience level. Only unaligned animals can be attracted; befriended; and trained. The material components of this spell are the caster's holy symbol and a piece of food liked by the animal. 
1,Bless ,Conjuration/Summoning,All,60 yds.,VSM,6 rds.,1 rd.,50-ft. cube,None,Reversible. Upon uttering the bless spell; the caster raises the morale of friendly creatures and any saving throw rolls they make against fear effects by +1. Furthermore; it raises their attack dice rolls by +1. A blessing; however; affects only those not already engaged in melee combat. The caster determines at what range (up to 60 yards) he will cast the spell. At the instant the spell is completed; it affects all creatures in a 50-foot cube centered on the point selected by the caster (thus; affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not). A second use of this spell is to bless a single item (for example; a crossbow bolt for use against a rakshasa). The weight of the item is limited to one pound per caster level and the effect lasts until the item is used or the spell duration ends. Multiple bless spells are not cumulative. In addition to the verbal and somatic gesture components; the bless spell requires holy water. This spell can be reversed by the priest to a curse spell that; when cast upon enemy creatures; lowers their morale and attack rolls by -1. The curse requires the sprinkling of unholy water. 
1,Combine,Evocation,All,Touch,VS,Special,1 rd.,Circle of priests,None,Using this spell; three to five priests combine their abilities so that one of them casts spells and turns undead at an enhanced level. The highest-level priest (or one of them; if two or more are tied for highest) stands alone; while the others join hands in a surrounding circle. The central priest casts the combine spell. He temporarily gains one level for each priest in the circle; up to a maximum gain of four levels. The level increase affects turning undead and spell details that vary with the caster's level. Note that the central priest gains no additional spells and that the group is limited to his currently memorized spells. The encircling priests must concentrate on maintaining the combine effect. They lose all Armor Class bonuses for shield and Dexterity. If any of them has his concentration broken; the combine spell ends immediately. If the combine spell is broken while the central priest is in the act of casting a spell; that spell is ruined just as if the caster were disturbed. Spells cast in combination have the full enhanced effect; even if the combine is broken before the duration of the enhanced spell ends. Note that the combination is not broken if only the central caster is disturbed. 
1,Command,Enchantment/Charm,Charm,30 yds.,V,1 rd.,1,1 creature,None,"This spell enables the priest to command another creature with a single word. The command must be uttered in a language understood by the creature. The subject will obey to the best of his/its ability only as long as the command is absolutely clear and unequivocal; thus; a command of ""Suicide!"" is ignored. A command to ""Die!"" causes the creature to fall in a faint or cataleptic state for one round; but thereafter the creature revives and is alive and well. Typical commands are back; halt; flee; run; stop; fall; go; leave; surrender; sleep; rest; etc. No command affects a creature for more than one round; undead are not affected at all. Creatures with Intelligence of 13 (high) or more; or those with 6 or more Hit Dice (or experience levels) are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell; adjusted for Wisdom. (Creatures with 13 or higher Intelligence and 6 Hit Dice/levels get only one saving throw!) "
1,Create Water,Alteration,Elemental (Water),30 yds.,VSM,Permanent,1 rd.,Up to 27 cu. ft.,None,Reversible. When the priest casts a create water spell; up to four gallons of water are generated for every experience level of the caster (for example; a 2nd-level priest creates up to 8 gallons of water; a 3rd-level priest up to 12 gallons; etc.). The water is clean and drinkable (it is just like rain water). The created water can be dispelled within a round of its creation; otherwise; its magic fades; leaving normal water that can be used; spilled; evaporated; etc. The reverse of the spell; destroy water; obliterates without trace (no vapor; mist; fog; or steam) a like quantity of water. Water can be created or destroyed in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid; or in an area as large as 27 cubic feet (1 cubic yard). Note that water can neither be created nor destroyed within a creature. For reference purposes; water weighs about 81/2pounds per gallon; and a cubic foot of water weighs approximately 64 pounds. The create water spell requires at least a drop of water; the destroy water spell; at least a pinch of dust. 
1,Cure Light Wounds,Necromancy,Healing,Touch,VS,Permanent,5,Creature touched,None,Reversible. When casting this spell and laying his hand upon a creature; the priest causes 1d8 points of wound or other injury damage to the creature's body to be healed. This healing cannot affect creatures without corporeal bodies; nor can it cure wounds of creatures not living or of extraplanar origin. The reverse of the spell; cause light wounds; operates in the same manner; inflicting 1d8 points of damage. If a creature is avoiding this touch; an attack roll is needed to determine if the priest's hand strikes the opponent and causes such a wound. Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal--or can be cured--just as any normal injury. 
1,Detect Evil ,Divination,All,0,VSM,1 turn + 5 rds./level,1 rd.,10 ft. x 120 yds.,None,Reversible. This spell discovers emanations of evil; or of good in the case of the reverse spell; from any creature; object; or area. Character alignment; however; is revealed only under unusual circumstances: characters who are strongly aligned; who do not stray from their faith; and who are of at least 9th level might radiate good or evil if intent upon appropriate actions. Powerful monsters; such as rakshasas or ki-rin; send forth emanations of evil or good; even if polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate evil; for it is this power and negative force that enable them to continue existing. An evilly cursed object or unholy water radiates evil; but a hidden trap or an unintelligent viper does not. The degree of evil (dim; faint; moderate; strong; or overwhelming) and possibly its general nature (expectant; malignant; gloating; etc.) can be noted. If the evil is overwhelming; the priest has a 10% chance per level of detecting its general bent (lawful; neutral; or chaotic). The duration of a detect evil (or detect good) spell is one turn plus five rounds per level of the priest. Thus; a 1st-level priest can cast a spell with a 15-round duration; a 2nd-level priest can cast a spell with a 20-round duration; etc. The spell has a path of detection 10 feet wide in the direction the priest is facing. The priest must concentrate--stop; have quiet; and intently seek to detect the aura--for at least one round to receive a reading. The spell requires the use of the priest's holy symbol as its material component; with the priest holding it before him. 
1,Detect Magic,Divination,Divination,0,VSM,1 turn,1 rd.,10 ft. x 30 yds.,None,When the detect magic spell is cast; the priest detects magical radiations in a path 10 feet wide and up to 30 yards long; in the direction he is facing. The intensity of the magic can be detected (dim; faint; moderate; strong; or overwhelming). The caster has a 10% chance per level to determine the sphere of the magic; but unlike the wizard version of the spell; the type of magic (alteration; conjuration; etc.) cannot be divined. The caster can turn; scanning a 60 arc per round. The spell is blocked by solid stone at least 1 foot thick; solid metal at least 1 inch thick; or solid wood at least 1 yard thick. The spell requires the use of the priest's holy symbol.
1,Detect Poison,Divination,Divination,0,VSM,1 turn + 1 rd./level,4,Special,None,This spell enables the priest to determine if an object has been poisoned or is poisonous. One object; or one 5-foot cubic mass; can be checked per round. The priest has a 5% chance per level of determining the exact type of poison. The material component is a strip of specially blessed vellum; which turns black if poison is present. 
1,Detect Snares & Pits,Divination,Divination,0,VSM,4 rds./level,4,10 x 40 ft.,None,Upon casting this spell; the caster is able to detect snares; pits; deadfalls and similar hazards along a path 10 feet wide and 40 feet long. Such hazards include simple pits; deadfalls; snares of wilderness creatures (for example; trapdoor spiders; giant sundews; ant lions; etc.); and primitive traps constructed of natural materials (mantraps; missile trips; hunting snares; etc.). The spell is directional--the caster must face the desired direction to determine if a pit exists or a trap is laid in that direction. The caster experiences a feeling of danger from the direction of a detected hazard; which increases as the danger is approached. The caster learns the general nature of the danger (pit; snare; or deadfall) but not its exact operation; nor how to disarm it. Close examination; however; enables the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it. The spell detects certain natural hazards--quicksand (snare); sinkholes (pit); or unsafe walls of natural rock (deadfall). Other hazards; such as a cavern that floods during rain; an unsafe construction; or a naturally poisonous plant; are not revealed. The spell does not detect magical traps (save those that operate by pit; deadfall; or snaring; see the 2nd-level spell trip and the 3rd-level spell snare); nor those that are mechanically complex; nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive. The caster must have his holy symbol to complete the spell. 
1,Endure Heat/Endure Cold,Alteration,Protection,Touch,VS,11/2hrs./level,1 rd.,Creature touched,None,The creature receiving this spell is protected from normal extremes of cold or heat (depending on which application the priest selects at the time of casting). The creature can stand unprotected in temperatures as low as -30 F. or as high as 130 F. (depending on application) with no ill effect. Temperatures beyond these limits inflict 1 point of damage per hour of exposure for every degree beyond the limit. The spell is immediately cancelled if the recipient is affected by any non-normal heat or cold; such as magic; breath weapons; and so on. The cancellation occurs regardless of the application and regardless of whether a heat or cold effect hits the character (for example; an endure cold spell is cancelled by magical heat or fire as well as by magical cold). The recipient of the spell does not suffer the first 10 points of damage (after any applicable saving throws) from the heat or cold during the round in which the spell is broken. The spell ends instantly if either resist fire or resist cold is cast upon the recipient. 
1,Entangle,Alteration,Plant,80 yds.,VSM,1 turn,4,40-ft. cube,2-Jan,By means of this spell; the caster is able to cause plants in the area of effect to entangle creatures within the area. The grasses; weeds; bushes; and even trees wrap; twist; and entwine about the creatures; holding them fast for the duration of the spell. Any creature entering the area is subject to this effect. A creature that rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell can escape the area; moving at only 10 feet per round until out of the area. Exceptionally large (gargantuan) or strong creatures may suffer little or no distress from this spell; at the DM's option; based on the strength of the entangling plants. The material component is the caster's holy symbol. 
1,Faerie Fire,Alteration,Weather,80 yds.,VM,4 rds./level,4,10 sq. ft/level within a 40-ft. radius,None,This spell enables the caster to outline one or more objects or creatures with a pale glowing light. The number of subjects outlined depends upon the number of square feet the caster can affect. Sufficient footage enables several objects or creatures to be outlined by the faerie fire spell; but one must be fully outlined before the next is begun; and all must be within the area of effect. Outlined objects or creatures are visible at 80 yards in the dark and 40 yards if the viewer is near a bright light source. Outlined creatures are easier to strike; thus; opponents gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls in darkness (including moonlit nights) and a +1 bonus in twilight or better. Note that outlining can render otherwise invisible creatures visible. However; it cannot outline noncorporeal; ethereal; or gaseous creatures. Nor does the light come anywhere close to sunlight. Therefore; it has no special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures. The faerie fire can be blue; green; or violet according to the word of the caster at the time of casting. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the object or creature thus outlined. The material component is a small piece of foxfire. 
1,Invisibility to Animals,Alteration,Animal,Touch,SM,1 turn + 1 rd./level,4,1 creature/level,None,When an invisibility to animals spell is cast; the creature touched becomes totally undetectable by normal animals with Intelligences under 6. Normal animals includes giant-sized varieties; but it excludes any with magical abilities or powers. The enchanted individual is able to walk among such animals or pass through them as if he did not exist. For example; this individual could stand before the hungriest of lions or a tyrannosaurus rex and not be molested or even noticed. However; a nightmare; hell hound; or winter wolf would certainly be aware of the individual. For every level the caster has achieved; one creature can be rendered invisible. Any recipient attacking while this spell is in effect ends the spell immediately (for himself only). The material component of this spell is holly rubbed over the recipient. 
1,Invisibility to Undead,Abjuration,Necromantic,Touch,VSM,6 rds.,4,1 creature,Special,This spell causes affected undead to lose track of and ignore the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Undead of 4 or fewer Hit Dice are automatically affected; but those with more Hit Dice receive a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. Note that a priest protected by this spell cannot turn affected undead. The spell ends immediately if the recipient makes any attack; although casting spells such as cure light wounds; augury; or chant does not end the ward. The material component is the priest's holy symbol. 
1,Light,Alteration,Sun,120 yds.,VS,1 hr. + 1 turn/level,4,20-ft.-radius globe,Special,Reversible. This spell causes a luminous glow within 20 feet of the spell's center. The area of light thus caused is equal in brightness to torchlight. Objects in darkness beyond this sphere can be seen; at best; as vague and shadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a point selected by the caster; and he must have a line of sight or unobstructed path to that point when the spell is cast. Light can spring from air; rock; metal; wood; or almost any similar substance. The effect is immobile unless it is specifically centered on a movable object or mobile creature. If this spell is cast upon a creature; any applicable magic resistance and saving throws must be rolled. Successful resistance negates the spell; while a successful saving throw indicates that the spell is centered immediately behind the creature; rather than upon the creature itself. A light spell centered on the visual organs of a creature blinds it; reducing its attack and saving throw rolls by 4 and worsening its Armor Class by 4. The caster can extinguish the light at any time by uttering a single word. Light spells are not cumulative--multiple castings do not provide a brighter light. The spell is reversible; causing darkness in the same area and under the same conditions as the light spell; but with half the duration. Magical darkness is equal to that of an unlit interior room--pitch darkness. Any normal light source or magical light source of lesser intensity than full daylight does not function in magical darkness. A darkness spell cast directly against a light spell cancels both; and vice versa. 
1,Locate Animals or Plants,Divination,Divination (Animal; Plant),100 yds. + 20 yds./level,VSM,1 rd./level,1 rd.,20 yds./level x 20 ft.,None,The caster can find the direction and distance of any one type of animal or plant he desires. The caster; facing in a direction; thinks of the animal or plant; and then knows if any such animal or plant is within range. If so; the exact distance and approximate number present is learned. During each round of the spell's duration; the caster can face in only one direction (i.e.; only a 20-foot-wide path can be known). The spell lasts one round per level of experience of the caster; while the length of the path is 100 yards plus 20 yards per level of experience. (At the DM's option; some casters may be able to locate only those animals [or plants] associated closely with their own mythos.) While the exact chance of locating a specific type of animal or plant depends on the details and circumstances of the locale; the general frequency of the subject can be used as a guideline: common = 50%; uncommon = 30%; rare = 15%; and very rare = 5%. Most herbs grow in temperate regions; while most spices grow in tropical regions. Most plants sought as spell components or for magical research are rare or very rare. The results of this spell are always determined by the DM. The material component is the caster's holy symbol. 
1,Magical Stone,Enchantment,Combat,Touch,VSM,Special,4,3 pebbles,None,By using this spell; the priest can temporarily enchant up to three small pebbles; no larger than sling bullets. The magical stones can then be hurled or slung at an opponent. If hurled; they can be thrown up to 30 yards; and all three can be thrown in one round. The character using them must roll normally to hit; although the magic of the stones enables any character to be proficient with them. The stones are considered +1 weapons for determining if a creature can be struck (those struck only by magical weapons; for instance); although they do not have an attack or damage bonus. Each stone that hits inflicts 1d4 points of damage (2d4 points against undead). The magic in each stone lasts only for half an hour; or until used. The material components are the priest's holy symbol and three small pebbles; unworked by tools or magic of any type. 
1,Pass Without Trace,Enchantment/Charm,Plant,Touch,VSM,1 turn/level,1 rd.,1 creature,None,When this spell is cast; the recipient can move through any type of terrain--mud; snow; dust; etc.--and leave neither footprints nor scent. The area that is passed over radiates magic for 1d6 turns after the affected creature passes. Thus; tracking a person or other creature covered by this spell is impossible by normal means. Of course; intelligent tracking techniques; such as using a spiral search pattern; can result in the trackers picking up the trail at a point where the spell has worn off. The material component of this spell is a sprig of pine or evergreen; which must be burned and the ashes powdered and scattered when the spell is cast. 
1,Protection From Evil,Abjuration,Protection,Touch,VSM,3 rds./level,4,1 creature,None,Reversible. When this spell is cast; it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has three major effects:First; all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll; and any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus. Second; any attempt to exercise mental control over the protected creature (if; for example; it has been charmed by a vampire) or to invade and take over its mind (as by a ghost's magic jar attack) is blocked by this spell. Note that the protection does not prevent a vampire's charm itself; nor end it; but it does prevent the vampire from exercising mental control through the barrier. Likewise; an outside life force is merely kept out; and would not be expelled if in place before the protection was cast. Third; the spell prevents bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured nature (such as aerial servants; elementals; imps; invisible stalkers; salamanders; water weirds; xorn; and others). This causes the natural (body) weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creature to recoil if such attacks require touching the protected creature. Animals or monsters summoned or conjured by spells or similar magic are likewise hedged from the character. This protection ends if the protected character makes a melee attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. To complete this spell; the priest uses holy water or burning incense. This spell can be reversed to become protection from good; with the second and third benefits remaining unchanged. The material components for the reverse are a circle of unholy water or smoldering dung. 
1,Purify Food & Drink,Alteration,All,30 yds.,VS,Permanent,1 rd.,1 cu. ft./level; in 10 sq. ft.,None,Reversible. When cast; this spell makes spoiled; rotten; poisonous; or otherwise contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and drinking. Up to 1 cubic foot of food and drink per level can be thus made suitable for consumption. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of significance is spoiled by purify food and drink; but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type nor upon magical potions. The reverse of the spell is putrefy food and drink. This spoils even holy water; however; it likewise has no effect upon creatures or potions. 
1,Remove Fear,Abjuration,Charm,10 yds.,VS,Special,1,1 creature/4 levels,Special,Reversible. The priest casting this spell instills courage in the spell recipient; raising the creature's saving throw rolls against magical fear attacks by +4 for one turn. If the recipient has recently (that day) failed a saving throw against such an attack; the spell immediately grants another saving throw; with a +4 bonus to the die roll. For every four levels of the caster; one creature can be affected by the spell (one creature at levels 1 through 4; two creatures at levels 5 through 8; etc.). The reverse of the spell; cause fear; causes one creature to flee in panic at maximum movement speed away from the caster for 1d4 rounds. A successful saving throw against the reversed effect negates it; and any Wisdom adjustment also applies. Of course; cause fear can be automatically countered by remove fear and vice versa. Neither spell has any effect on undead of any sort. 
1,Sanctuary,Abjuration,Protection,Touch,VSM,2 rds. + 1 rd./level,4,1 creature,None,When the priest casts a sanctuary spell; any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the protected creature must roll a saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful; the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the saving throw is failed; the opponent loses track of and totally ignores the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. Note that this spell does not prevent the operation of area attacks (fireball; ice storm; etc.). While protected by this spell; the subject cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell; but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a warded priest to heal wounds; for example; or to bless; perform an augury; chant; cast a light in the area (but not upon an opponent); and so on. The components of the spell include the priest's holy symbol and a small silver mirror. 
1,Shillelagh ,Alteration,Combat; Plant,Touch,VSM,4 rds. + 1 rd./level,2,1 oak club,None,This spell enables the caster to change his own oak cudgel or unshod staff into a magical weapon that gains a +1 bonus to its attack roll and inflicts 2d4 points of damage on opponents up to man size; and 1d4+1 points of damage on larger opponents. The spell inflicts no damage to the staff or cudgel. The caster must wield the shillelagh; of course. The material components of this spell are a shamrock leaf and the caster's holy symbol. 
2,Aid,Necromancy; Conjuration,Necromantic,Touch,VSM,1 rd. + 1 rd./level,5,1 creature,None,The recipient of this spell gains the benefit of a bless spell (+1 to attack rolls and saving throws) and a special bonus of 1d8 additional hit points for the duration of the spell. The aid spell enables the recipient to actually have more hit points than his full normal total. The bonus hit points are lost first when the recipient takes damage; they cannot be regained by curative magic. For example; a 1st-level fighter has 8 hit points; suffers 2 points of damage (8-2 = 6); and then receives an aid spell that gives 5 additional hit points. The fighter now has 11 hit points; 5 of which are temporary. If he is then hit for 7 points of damage; 2 normal hit points and all 5 temporary hit points are lost. He then receives a cure light wounds spell that heals 4 points of damage; restoring him to his original 8 hit points. Note that the operation of the spell is unaffected by permanent hit point losses due to energy drain; Hit Die losses; the loss of a familiar; or the operation of certain artifacts; the temporary hit point gain is figured from the new; lower total. The material components of this spell are a tiny strip of white cloth with a sticky substance (such as tree sap) on the ends; plus the priest's holy symbol. 
2,Augury,Divination,Divination,0,VSM,Special,2 rds.,Special,None,"The priest casting an augury spell seeks to divine whether an action in the immediate future (within one-half hour) will benefit or harm the party. For example; if a party is considering the destruction of a weird seal that closes a portal; an augury spell can be used to find if weal or woe will be the immediate result. If the spell is successful; the DM yields some indication of the probable outcome: ""weal;"" ""woe;"" or possibly a cryptic puzzle or rhyme. The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70%; plus 1% for each level of the priest casting the spell; for example; 71% at 1st level; 72% at 2nd; etc. Your DM determines any adjustments for the particular conditions of each augury. For example; if the question is ""Will we do well if we venture to the third level?"" and a terrible troll guarding 10;000 sp and a shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the level (which the DM estimates the party could beat after a hard fight); the augury might be: ""Great risk brings great reward."" If the troll is too strong for the party; the augury might be: ""Woe and destruction await!"" Likewise; a party casting several auguries about the same action in quick succession might receive identical answers; regardless of the dice rolls. The material component for an augury spell is a set of gem-inlaid sticks; dragon bones; or similar tokens of at least 1;000 gp value (which are not expended in casting). "
2,Barkskin,Alteration,Protection; Plant,Touch,VSM,4 rds. + 1 rd./level,5,1 creature,None,When a priest casts the barkskin spell upon a creature; its skin becomes as tough as bark; increasing its base Armor Class to AC 6; plus 1 AC for every four levels of the priest: Armor Class 5 at 4th level; Armor Class 4 at 8th; and so on. This spell does not function in combination with normal armor or any magical protection. In addition; saving throw rolls vs. all attack forms except magic gain a +1 bonus. This spell can be placed on the caster or on any other creature he touches. In addition to his holy symbol; the caster must have a handful of bark from an oak as the material component for the spell. 
2,Chant,Conjuration/Summoning,Combat,0,VS,Time of chanting,2 rds.,30-ft. radius,None,By means of the chant spell; the priest brings special favor upon himself and his party; and causes harm to his enemies. When the chant spell is completed; all attack and damage rolls and saving throws made by those in the area of effect who are friendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses; while those of the priest's enemies suffer -1 penalties. This bonus/penalty continues as long as the caster continues to chant the mystic syllables and is stationary. However; an interruption (such as an attack that succeeds and causes damage; grappling with the chanter; or a silence spell) breaks the spell. Multiple chants are not cumulative; however; if the 3rd-level prayer spell is spoken while a priest of the same religious persuasion (not merely alignment) is chanting; the effect is increased to +2 and -2. 
2,Charm Person or Mammal,Enchantment/Charm,Animal,80 yds.,VS,Special,5,1 person or mammal,Neg.,"This spell affects any single person or mammal it is cast upon. The creature then regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The term person includes any bipedal human; demihuman or humanoid of man size or smaller; including brownies; dryads; dwarves; elves; gnolls; gnomes; goblins; half-elves; halflings; half-orcs; hobgoblins; humans; kobolds; lizard men; nixies; orcs; pixies; sprites; troglodytes; and others. Thus; a 10th-level fighter is included; while an ogre is not. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton; but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way. Thus; a charmed creature would not obey a suicide command; but might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the creature to hold back an onrushing red dragon for ""just a minute or two"" and if the charmed creature's view of the situation suggests that this course of action still allows a reasonable chance of survival. The subject's attitudes and priorities are changed with respect to the caster; but basic personality and alignment are not. A request that a victim make itself defenseless; give up a valued item; or even use a charge from a valued item (especially against former associates or allies) might allow an immediate saving throw to see if the charm is thrown off. Likewise; a charmed creature does not necessarily reveal everything it knows or draw maps of entire areas. Any request may be refused; if such refusal is in character and does not directly harm the caster. The victim's regard for the caster does not necessarily extend to the caster's friends or allies. The victim does not react well to the charmer's allies making suggestions such as; ""Ask him this question. . .;"" nor does the charmed creature put up with verbal or physical abuse from the charmer's associates; if this is out of character. Note also that the spell does not empower the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally has. The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed creature's Intelligence; and it is tied to the saving throw. A successful saving throw breaks the spell. This saving throw is checked on a periodic basis according to the creature's Intelligence; even if the caster has not overly strained the relationship. (Intelligence Score / Period Between Checks): (3 or less /  3 months); (4-6 / 2 months); (7-9 / 1 month); (10-12 / 3 weeks); (13-14 / 2 weeks); (15-16 / 1 week); (17 / 3 days); (18 / 2 days); (19 or more / 1 day). If the caster harms; or attempts to harm; the charmed creature by some overt action; or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed creature; the charm is broken automatically. If the subject of the charm person/charm mammal spell successfully rolls its saving throw vs. the spell; the effect is negated. This spell; if used in conjunction with the animal friendship spell; can keep the animal near the caster's home base; if the caster must leave for an extended period. "
2,Detect Charm,Divination,Divination,30 yds.,VS,1 turn,1 rd.,1 creature/rd.,Neg.,Reversible. When used by a priest; this spell can detect if a person or monster is under the influence of a charm spell; or similar control such as hypnosis; suggestion; beguiling; possession; etc. The creature rolls a saving throw vs. spell and; if successful; the caster learns nothing about that particular creature from the casting. A caster who learns that a creature is being influenced has a 5% chance per level to determine the exact type of influence. Up to 10 different creatures can be checked before the spell wanes. If the creature is under more than one such effect; only the information that the charms exist is gained. The type (since there are conflicting emanations) is impossible to determine. The reverse of the spell; undetectable charm; completely masks all charms on a single creature for 24 hours. 
2,Dust Devil,Conjuration/Summoning,Elemental (Air),30 yds.,VS,2 rds./level,2 rds.,5 x 4 ft. cone,None,This spell enables a priest to conjure up a weak air elemental--a dust devil of AC 4; 2 HD; MV 180 feet per round; one attack for 1d4 points of damage--which can be hit by normal weapons. The dust devil appears as a small whirlwind 1 foot in diameter at its base; 5 feet tall; and 3 to 4 feet across at the top. It moves as directed by the priest; but dissipates if it is ever separated from the caster by more than 30 yards. Its winds are sufficient to put out torches; small campfires; exposed lanterns; and other small; open flames of nonmagical origin. The dust devil can hold a gas cloud or a creature in gaseous form at bay or push it away from the caster (though it cannot damage or disperse such a cloud). If skimming along the ground in an area of loose dust; sand; or ash; the dust devil picks up those particles and disperses them in a 10-foot-diameter cloud centered on itself. The cloud obscures normal vision; and creatures caught within are blinded while inside and for one round after they emerge. A spellcaster caught in the dust devil or its cloud while casting must make a saving throw vs. spell to keep his concentration; or the spell is ruined. Any creature native to the Elemental Plane of Air--even another dust devil--can disperse a dust devil with a single hit. 
2,Enthrall,Enchantment/Charm,Charm,0,VS,Special,1 rd.,90-ft. radius,Neg.,A priest using this spell can enthrall an audience that can fully understand his language. Those in the area of effect must successfully save vs. spell or give the caster their undivided attention; totally ignoring their surroundings. Those of a race or religion unfriendly to the caster's have a +4 bonus to the roll. Any Wisdom adjustment also applies. Creatures with 4 or more levels or Hit Dice; or with a Wisdom of 16 or better; are unaffected. To cast the spell; the caster must speak without interruption for a full round. Thereafter; the enchantment lasts as long as the priest speaks; to a maximum of one hour. Those enthralled take no action while the priest speaks; and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the matter. Those entering the area of effect must also successfully save vs. spell or become enthralled. Those not enthralled are 50% likely every turn to hoot and jeer in unison. If there is excessive jeering; the rest are allowed a new saving throw. The speech ends (but the 1d3 round delay still applies) if the priest is successfully attacked or performs any action other than speaking. If the audience is attacked; the spell ends and the audience reacts immediately; rolling a reaction check with respect to the source of the interruption; at a penalty of -10. Note: When handling a large number of saving throws for similar creatures; the DM can assume an average to save time; for example; a crowd of 20 men with a base saving throw of 16 (25% success chance) will have 15 men enthralled and five not. 
2,Find Traps,Divination,Divination,0,VS,3 turns,5,10 ft. x 30 yds.,None,When a priest casts a find traps spell; all traps--concealed normally or magically--of magical or mechanical nature become apparent to him. Note that this spell is directional; and the caster must face the desired direction in order to determine if a trap is laid in that particular direction. A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result; the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful; and the harmful or undesirable result was specifically intended as such by the creator. Thus; traps include alarms; glyphs; and similar spells or devices. The caster learns the general nature of the trap (magical or mechanical) but not its exact effect; nor how to disarm it. Close examination will; however; enable the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it. Note that the caster's divination is limited to his knowledge of what might be unexpected and harmful. The spell cannot predict actions of creatures (hence; a concealed murder hole or ambush is not a trap); nor are natural hazards considered traps (a cavern that floods during a rain; a wall weakened by age; a naturally poisonous plant; etc.). If the DM is using specific glyphs or sigils to identify magical wards (see the 3rd-level spell glyph of warding); this spell shows the form of the glyph or mark. The spell does not detect traps that have been disarmed or are otherwise inactive. 
2,Fire Trap,Abjuration; Evocation,Elemental (Fire),Touch,VSM,Permanent until discharged,1 turn,Object touched,2-Jan,Any closeable item (book; box; bottle; chest; coffer; coffin; door; drawer; and so forth) can be warded by a fire trap spell. The spell is centered on a point selected by the spellcaster. The item so trapped cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed upon it. A knock spell cannot affect a fire trap in any way--as soon as the offending party opens the item; the trap discharges. As with most magical traps; a thief has only half his normal find traps score to detect a fire trap. Failure to remove it successfully detonates it immediately. An unsuccessful dispel magic spell will not detonate the spell. When the trap is discharged; there will be an explosion of 5-foot radius from the spell's center. All creatures within this area must roll saving throws vs. spell. Damage is 1d4 points plus 1 point per level of the caster; and half that total amount for creatures successfully saving. (Under water; this ward inflicts half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.) The item trapped is not harmed by this explosion. The caster can use the trapped object without discharging it; as can any individual to whom the spell was specifically attuned when cast (the method usually involves a key word). To place this spell; the caster must trace the outline of the closure with a stick of charcoal and touch the center of the effect. Attunement to another individual requires a hair or similar object from the individual. The material components are holly berries. 
2,Flame Blade,Evocation,Elemental (Fire),0,VSM,4 rds. + 1 rd./2 levels,4,3-ft. long blade,None,With this spell; the caster causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from his hand. This bladelike ray is wielded as if it were a scimitar. If the caster successfully hits with the flame blade in melee combat; the creature struck suffers 1d4+4 points of damage; with a damage bonus of +2 (i. e.; 7-10 points) if the creature is undead or is especially vulnerable to fire. If the creature is protected from fire; the damage inflicted is reduced by 2 (i.e.; 1d4+2 points). Fire dwellers and those using fire as an innate attack form suffer no damage from the spell. The flame blade can ignite combustible materials such as parchment; straw; dry sticks; cloth; etc. However; it is not a magical weapon in the normal sense of the term; so creatures (other than undead) struck only by magical weapons are not harmed by it. This spell does not function under water. In addition to the caster's holy symbol; the spell requires a leaf of sumac as a material component. 
2,Goodberry,Alteration; Evocation,Plant,Touch,VSM,1 day + 1 day/level,1 rd.,2d4 fresh berries,None,Casting a goodberry spell upon a handful of freshly picked berries makes 2d4 of them magical. The caster (as well as any other caster of the same faith and 3rd or higher level) can immediately discern which berries are affected. A detect magic spell discovers this also. Berries with the magic either enable a hungry creature of approximately man size to eat one and be as well-nourished as if a full normal meal were eaten; or else cure 1 point of physical damage from wounds or other similar causes; subject to a maximum of 8 points of such curing in any 24-hour period. The reverse of the spell; badberry; causes 2d4 rotten berries to appear wholesome; but each actually delivers 1 point of poison damage (no saving throw) if ingested. The material component of the spell is the caster's holy symbol passed over the freshly picked; edible berries to be enspelled (blueberries; blackberries; raspberries; currants; gooseberries; etc.). 
2,Heat Metal,Alteration,Elemental (Fire),40 yds.,VSM,7 rds.,5,Special,Special,Reversible. By means of the heat metal spell; the caster is able to make ferrous metal (iron; iron alloys; steel) extremely hot. Elven chain mail is not affected; and magical metal armor receives an item saving throw vs. magical fire to avoid being heated. The material component is a holy symbol. On the first round of the spell; the metal merely becomes very warm and uncomfortable to touch (this is also the effect on the last melee round of the spell's duration). During the second and sixth (next to the last) rounds; heat causes blisters and damage; in the third; fourth; and fifth rounds; the metal becomes searing hot; causing damage to exposed flesh; as shown below: (Metal Temperature / Damage per Round): (very warm / none); (hot / 1d4 points); (searing* / 2d4 points). * On the final round of searing; the afflicted creature must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or suffer one of the following disabilities: hand or foot--becomes unusable for 2d4 days; body--becomes disabled for 1d4 days; head--fall unconscious for 1d4 turns. This effect can be completely removed by the 6th-level priest spell heal spell or by normal rest. Note also that materials such as wood; leather; or flammable cloth smolder and burn if exposed to searing hot metal. Such materials cause searing damage to exposed flesh on the next round. Fire resistance (spell; potion; or ring) or a protection from fire spell totally negates the effects of a heat metal spell; as does immersion in water or snow; or exposure to a cold or ice storm spell. This version of the spell does not function under water. For every two experience levels of the caster; the metal of one man-sized creature can be affected (i.e.; arms and armor; or a single mass of metal equal to 50 pounds of weight). Thus; a 3rd-level caster would affect one such creature; a 4th- or 5th-level caster two; etc. The reverse of the spell; chill metal; counters a heat metal spell or else causes metal to act as follows: (Metal Temperature / Damage per Round): (cold / none); (icy / 1-2 points); (freezing* / 1d4 points). * On the final round of freezing; the afflicted creature must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or suffer from the numbing effects of the cold. This causes the loss of all feeling in a hand (or hands; if the DM rules the saving throw was failed badly) for 1d4 days. During this time; the character's grip is extremely weak and he cannot use that hand for fighting or any other activity requiring a firm grasp. The chill metal spell is countered by a resist cold spell; or by any great heat--proximity to a blazing fire (not a mere torch); a magical flaming sword; a wall of fire spell; etc. Under water; this version of the spell inflicts no damage; but ice immediately forms around the affected metal; exerting an upward buoyancy. 
2,Hold Person,Enchantment/Charm,Charm,120 yds.,VSM,2 rds./level,5,1d4 persons in 20-ft. cube,Neg.,This spell holds 1d4 humans; demihumans; or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for a minimum of six rounds (the spell lasts 2 rounds per caster level; and the priest must be of at least 3rd level to cast the spell). The hold person spell affects any bipedal human; demihuman; or humanoid of man size or smaller; including brownies; dryads; dwarves; elves; gnolls; gnomes; goblins; half- elves; halflings; half-orcs; hobgoblins; humans; kobolds; lizard men; nixies; orcs; pixies; sprites; troglodytes; and others. Thus; a 10th-level fighter could be held; while an ogre could not. The effect is centered on a point selected by the caster; and it affects persons selected by the caster within the area of effect. If the spell is cast at three persons; each gets a normal saving throw; if only two persons are being enspelled; each rolls his saving throw with a -1 penalty; if the spell is cast at only one person; the saving throw die roll suffers a -2 penalty. Saving throws are adjusted for Wisdom. Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held. Held creatures cannot move or speak; but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds; disease; or poison. The priest casting the hold person spell can end the spell with a single utterance at any time; otherwise; the duration is six rounds at 3rd level; eight rounds at 4th level; etc. The spellcaster needs a small; straight piece of iron as the material component of this spell. 
2,Know Alignment,Divination,Divination,10 yds.,VS,1 turn,1 rd.,1 creature or object,Neg.,Reversible. A know alignment spell enables the priest to exactly read the aura of a creature or an aligned object (unaligned objects reveal nothing). The caster must remain stationary and concentrate on the subject for a full round. If the creature rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell; the caster learns nothing about that particular creature from the casting. Certain magical devices negate the power of the know alignment spell. The reverse; undetectable alignment; conceals the alignment of an object or creature for 24 hours. 
2,Messenger,Enchantment/Charm,Animal,20 yds./level,VS,1 day/level,1 rd.,1 creature,Neg.,This spell enables the priest to call upon a tiny (size T) creature of at least animal intelligence to act as his messenger. The spell does not affect giant animals and it does not work on creatures of low (i.e.; 5) Intelligence or higher. If the creature is within range; the priest; using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure; can call the animal to come. The animal is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is failed; the animal advances toward the priest and awaits his bidding. The priest can communicate with the animal in a crude fashion; telling it to go to a certain place; but directions must be simple. The spellcaster can attach some small item or note to the animal. If so instructed; the animal will then wait at that location until the duration of the spell expires. (Note that unless the intended recipient of a message is expecting a messenger in the form of a small animal or bird; the carrier may be ignored.) When the spell's duration expires; the animal or bird returns to its normal activities. The intended recipient of a message gains no communication ability. 
2,Obscurement,Alteration,Weather,0,VS,4 rds./level,5,(level x 10)-ft.-sq.,None,This spell causes a misty vapor to arise around the caster. It persists in this locale for four rounds per caster level and reduces the visibility ranges of all types of vision (including infravision) to 2d4 feet. The ground area affected by the spell is a square progression based on the caster's level: a 10-foot x 10-foot area at 1st level; a 20-foot x 20-foot area at 2nd level; a 30-foot x 30-foot area at 3rd level; and so on. The height of the vapor is restricted to 10 feet; although the cloud will otherwise expand to fill confined spaces. A strong wind (such as from the 3rd-level wizard spell gust of wind) can cut the duration of an obscurement spell by 75%. This spell does not function under water. 
2,Produce Flame ,Alteration,Elemental (Fire),0,VS,1 rd./level,5,Special,None,A bright flame; equal in brightness to a torch; springs forth from the caster's palm when he casts a produce flame spell. The flame does not harm the caster; but it is hot and it causes the combustion of flammable materials (paper; cloth; dry wood; oil; etc.). The caster is capable of hurling the magical flame as a missile; with a range of 40 yards (considered short range). The flame flashes on impact; igniting combustibles within a 3- foot diameter of its center of impact; and then it goes out. A creature struck by the flame suffers 1d4+1 points of damage and; if combustion occurs; must spend a round extinguishing the fire or suffer additional damage assigned by the DM until the fire is extinguished. A miss is resolved as a grenade-like missile. If any duration remains to the spell; another flame immediately appears in the caster's hand. The caster can hurl a maximum of one flame per level; but no more than one flame per round. The caster can snuff out magical flame any time he desires; but fire caused by the flame cannot be so extinguished. This spell does not function under water. 
2,Resist Fire/Resist Cold,Alteration,Protection,Touch,VSM,1 rd./level,5,1 creature,None,When this spell is placed upon a creature by a priest; the creature's body is toughened to withstand heat or cold; as chosen by the caster. The spell grants the creature complete immunity to mild conditions (standing naked in the snow or reaching into an ordinary fire to pluck out a note). The recipient can somewhat resist intense heat or cold (whether natural or magical in origin); such as red-hot charcoal; a large amount of burning oil; flaming swords; fire storms; fireballs; meteor swarms; red dragon's breath; frostbrand swords; ice storms; wands of frost; or white dragon's breath. In all of these cases; the temperature affects the creature to some extent. The recipient of the spell gains a bonus of +3 to saving throws against such attack forms and all damage sustained is reduced by 50%; therefore; if the saving throw is failed; the creature sustains one-half damage; and if the saving throw is successful; the creature sustains only one-quarter damage. Resistance to fire lasts for one round for each experience level of the priest placing the spell. The caster needs a drop of mercury as the material component of this spell. 
2,Silence; 15[FM] Radius,Alteration,Guardian,120 yds.,VS,2 rds./level,5,15-ft.-radius,None,Upon casting this spell; complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible; spells cannot be cast (or at least not those with verbal components; if the optional component rule is used); and no noise whatsoever issues from or enters the area. The spell can be cast into the air or upon an object; but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object or creature. The spell lasts two rounds for each level of experience of the priest. The spell can be centered upon a creature; and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature receives a saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw is successful; the spell effect is centered about 1 foot behind the position of the subject creature at the instant of casting. This spell provides a defense against sound-based attacks; such as harpy singing; horn of blasting; etc. 
2,Slow Poison,Necromancy,Healing,Touch,VSM,1 hr./level,1,1 creature,None,When this spell is placed upon a poisoned individual; it greatly slows the effects of venom; if cast upon the victim before the poison takes full effect. (This period; known as the onset time; is known to the DM.) While this spell does not neutralize the venom; it does prevent it from substantially harming the individual for the duration of its magic in the hope that; during that spell period; the poison can be fully cured. The material components of the slow poison spell are the priest's holy symbol and a bud of garlic that must be crushed and smeared on the wound (or eaten if poison was ingested). 
2,Snake Charm ,Enchantment/Charm,Animal,30 yds.,VS,Special,5,30-ft. cube,None,When this spell is cast; a hypnotic pattern is set up that causes one or more snakes to cease all activity except a semierect; swaying movement. If the snakes are charmed while in a torpor; the duration of the spell is 1d4+2 turns; if the snakes are not torpid; but are not aroused and angry; the charm lasts 1d3 turns; if the snakes are angry or attacking; the spell lasts 1d4+4 rounds. The priest casting the spell can charm snakes whose total hit points are less than or equal to those of the priest. On the average; a 1st-level priest could charm snakes with a total of 4 or 5 hit points; a 2nd-level priest could charm 9 hit points; etc. The hit points can be those of a single snake or those of several of the reptiles; but the total hit points cannot exceed those of the priest casting the spell. A 23-hit point caster charming a dozen 2-hit point snakes would charm 11 of them. This spell is also effective against any ophidian or ophidianoid monster; such as naga; couatl; etc.; subject to magic resistance; hit points; and so forth. Variations of this spell may exist; allowing other creatures significant to a particular mythos to be affected. Your DM will inform you if such spells exist. 
2,Speak With Animals,Alteration,Animal; Divination,0,VS,2 rds./level,5,1 animal within 30 ft.,None,This spell empowers the priest to comprehend and communicate with any warm- or cold-blooded normal or giant animal that is not mindless. The priest is able to ask questions of and receive answers from the creature; although friendliness and cooperation are by no means assured. Furthermore; terseness and evasiveness are likely in basically wary and cunning creatures (the more stupid ones will instead make inane comments). If the animal is friendly or of the same general alignment as the priest; it may do some favor or service for the priest (as determined by the DM). Note that this spell differs from the speak with monsters spell; for this spell allows conversation only with normal or giant nonfantastic creatures such as apes; bears; cats; dogs; elephants; and so on. 
2,Spiritual Hammer,Invocation,Combat,10 yds./level,VSM,3 rds. + 1 rd./level,5,Special,None,By calling upon his deity; the caster of a spiritual hammer spell brings into existence a field of force shaped vaguely like a hammer. As long as the caster concentrates upon the hammer; it strikes at any opponent within its range; as desired. Each round the caster can choose to attack the same target as the previous round or switch to a new target that he can see anywhere within his maximum range. The spiritual hammer's chance to successfully hit is equal to that of the caster; without any Strength bonuses. In addition; it strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every six experience levels (or fraction) of the spellcaster; up to a total of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster. The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer (1d4+1 points on opponents of man size or smaller; or 1d4 points on larger opponents; plus the magical bonus). The hammer strikes in the same direction as the caster is facing; so if he is behind the target; all bonuses for rear attack are gained along with the loss of any modifications to the target's AC for shield and Dexterity. As soon as the caster ceases concentration; the spiritual hammer spell ends. A dispel magic spell that includes either the caster or the force in its area of effect has a chance to dispel the spiritual hammer. If an attacked creature has magic resistance; the resistance is checked the first time the spiritual hammer strikes. If the hammer is successfully resisted; the spell is lost. If not; the hammer has its normal full effect for the duration of the spell. The material component of this spell is a normal war hammer that the priest must hurl toward opponents while uttering a plea to his deity. The hammer disappears when the spell is cast. 
2,Trip,Enchantment/Charm,Plant,Touch,VS,1 turn/level,5,1 object up to 10 ft. long,Neg.,This magic must be cast upon a normal object--a length of vine; a stick; a pole; a rope; or a similar object. The spell causes the object to rise slightly off the ground or floor it is resting on to trip most creatures crossing it; if they fail their saving throws vs. spell. Note that only as many creatures can be tripped as are actually stepping across the enchanted object. Thus; a 3-foot-long piece of rope could trip only one man-sized creature. Creatures moving at a very rapid pace (running) when tripped suffer 1 point of damage and are stunned for 1d4+1 rounds if the surface they fall upon is very hard (if it is turf or other soft material; they are merely stunned for the rest of that round). Very large creatures; such as elephants; are not affected at all by a trip spell. The object continues to trip all creatures passing over it; including the spellcaster; for as long as the spell duration lasts. A creature aware of the object and its potential adds a +4 bonus to its saving throw roll when crossing the object. The enchanted object is 80% undetectable unless a means that detects magical traps is employed or the operation of the spell is observed. This spell does not function under water. 
2,Warp Wood,Alteration,Plant,10 yds./level,VS,Permanent,5,Special,Special,Reversible. When this spell is cast; the priest causes a volume of wood to bend and warp; permanently destroying its straightness; form; and strength. The range of a warp wood spell is 10 yards for each level of experience of the caster. It affects approximately a 15- inch shaft of wood of up to 1-inch diameter per level of the caster. Thus; at 1st level; a caster might be able to warp a hand axe handle or four crossbow bolts; at 5th level; he could warp the shaft of a typical spear. Note that boards or planks can also be affected; causing a door to be sprung or a boat or ship to leak. Warped missile weapons are useless; warped melee weapons suffer a -4 penalty to their attack rolls. Enchanted wood is affected only if the spellcaster is of higher level than the caster of the prior enchantment. The spellcaster has a 20% cumulative chance of success per level of difference (20% if one level higher; 40% if two levels higher; etc.). Thus; a door magically held or wizard locked by a 5th-level wizard is 40% likely to be affected by a warp wood spell cast by a 7th-level priest. Wooden magical items are considered enchanted at 12th level (or better). Extremely powerful items; such as artifacts; are unaffected by this spell. The reversed spell; straighten wood; straightens bent or crooked wood; or reverses the effects of a warp wood spell; subject to the same restrictions. 
2,Withdraw ,Alteration,Protection,0,VS,Special,5,The caster,None,By means of a withdraw spell; the priest in effect alters the flow of time with regard to himself. While but one round of time passes for those not affected by the spell; the priest is able to spend two rounds; plus one round per level; in contemplation. Thus; a 5th-level priest can withdraw for seven rounds to cogitate on some matter while one round passes for all others. (The DM should allow the player one minute of real time per round withdrawn to ponder some problem or question. No discussion with other players is permitted.) Note that while affected by the withdraw spell; the caster can use only the following spells: any divination spell or any curing or healing spell; the latter on himself only. The casting of any of these spells in different fashion (for example; a cure light wounds spell bestowed upon a companion) negates the withdraw spell. Similarly; the withdrawn caster cannot walk or run; become invisible; or engage in actions other than thinking; reading; and the like. He can be affected by the actions of others; losing any Dexterity or shield bonus. Any successful attack upon the caster breaks the spell. 
2,Wyvern Watch ,Evocation,Guardian,30 yds.,VSM,up to 8 hrs.,5,10-ft. radius,Neg+J51.,"This spell is known as wyvern watch because of the insubstantial haze brought forth by its casting; which vaguely resembles a wyvern. It is typically used to guard some area against intrusion. Any creature approaching within 10 feet of the guarded area may be affected by the ""wyvern."" Any creature entering the guarded area must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or stand paralyzed for one round per level of the caster; until freed by the spellcaster; by a dispel magic spell; or by a remove paralysis spell. A successful saving throw indicates that the subject creature was missed by the attack of the wyvern- form; and the spell remains in place. As soon as a subject creature is successfully struck by the wyvern-form; the paralysis takes effect and the force of the spell dissipates. The spell force likewise dissipates if no intruder is struck by the wyvern-form for eight hours after the spell is cast. Any creature approaching the space being guarded by the wyvern- form may be able to detect its presence before coming close enough to be attacked; this chance of detection is 90% in bright light; 30% in twilight conditions; and 0% in darkness. The material component is the priest's holy symbol. "
3,Animate Dead,Necromancy,Necromantic,10 yds.,VSM,Permanent,1 rd.,Special,None,This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters; skeletons or zombies; usually from the bones or bodies of dead humans; demihumans; or humanoids. The spell causes these remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal commands of the caster; regardless of how they communicated in life. The skeletons or zombies can follow the caster; remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place; etc. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat or are turned; the magic cannot be dispelled. The priest can animate one skeleton or one zombie for each experience level he has attained. If creatures with more than 1+ Hit Dice are animated; the number is determined by the monster Hit Dice. Skeletal forms have the Hit Dice of the original creature; while zombie forms have 1 more Hit Die. Thus; a 12th-level priest could animate 12 dwarven skeletons (or six zombies); four zombie gnolls; or a single zombie fire giant. Note that this is based on the standard racial Hit Die norm; thus; a high-level adventurer would be animated as a skeleton or zombie of 1 or 2 Hit Dice; and without special class or racial abilities. The caster can; alternatively; animate two small animal skeletons (1-1 Hit Die or less) for every level of experience he has achieved. The spell requires a drop of blood; a piece of flesh of the type of creature being animated; and a pinch of bone powder or a bone shard to complete the spell. Casting this spell is not a good act; and only evil priests use it frequently. 
3,Call Lightning,Alteration,Weather,360 yds.,VS,1 turn/level,1 turn,10-ft. radius,2-Jan,When a call lightning spell is cast; there must be a storm of some sort in the area--a rain shower; clouds and wind; hot and cloudy conditions; or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinn or air elemental of 7 Hit Dice or more). The caster is then able to call down bolts of lightning. The caster can call down one bolt per turn. The caster need not call a bolt of lightning immediately--other actions; even spellcasting; can be performed; however; the caster must remain stationary and concentrate for a full round each time a bolt is called. The spell has a duration of one turn per caster level. Each bolt causes 2d8 points of electrical damage; plus an additional 1d8 points for each of the caster's experience levels. Thus; a 4th-level caster calls down a 6d8 bolt (2d8+4d8). The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever distance the spellcaster decides; up to 360 yards away. Any creature within a 10-foot radius of the path or the point where the lightning strikes suffers full damage unless a successful saving throw vs. spell is rolled; in which case only one-half damage is taken. Because it requires a storm overhead; this spell can only be used outdoors. It does not function under ground or under water. 
3,Continual Light,Alteration,Sun,120 yds.,VS,Permanent,6,60-ft. radius,Special,Reversible. This spell is similar to a light spell; except that it is as bright as full daylight and lasts until negated by magical darkness or by a dispel magic spell. Creatures with penalties in bright light suffer them in this spell's area of effect. As with the light spell; this can be cast into the air; onto an object; or at a creature. In the third case; the continual light affects the space about 1 foot behind a creature that successfully rolls its saving throw vs. spell (a failed saving throw means the continual light is centered on the creature and moves as it moves). Note that this spell also blinds a creature if it is successfully cast upon the creature's visual organs. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed in a light-proof covering; the spell effects are blocked until the covering is removed. Continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) cancels the darkness so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of a continual light spell against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both. This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon; but the process takes far longer than the time in a typical campaign. Extremely hard and expensive materials might last hundreds or even thousands of years. The reverse spell; continual darkness; causes complete absence of light (pitch blackness); similar to the darkness spell but of greater duration and area. 
3,Create Food & Water,Alteration,Creation,10 yds.,VS,Special,1 turn,1 cu. ft./level,None,When this spell is cast; the priest causes food and water to appear. The food thus created is highly nourishing if rather bland; each cubic foot of the material sustains three human-sized creatures or one horse-sized creature for a full day. The food decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours; although it can be restored for another 24 hours by casting a purify food and water spell upon it. The water created by this spell is the same as that created by the 1st-level priest spell create water. For each experience level the priest has attained; 1 cubic foot of food or water is created by the spell. For example; a 2nd-level priest could create 1 cubic foot of food and 1 cubic foot of water. 
3,Cure Blindness or Deafness,Abjuration,Necromantic,Touch,VS,Permanent,1 rd.,1 creature,Special,Reversible. By touching the creature afflicted; the priest employing the spell can permanently cure some forms of blindness or deafness. This spell does not restore or repair visual or auditory organs damaged by injury or disease. Its reverse; cause blindness or deafness; requires a successful touch (successful attack roll) on the victim. If the victim rolls a successful saving throw; the effect is negated. If the saving throw is failed; a nondamaging magical blindness or deafness results. A deafened creature can react only to what it can see or feel; and suffers a -1 penalty to surprise rolls; a +1 penalty to its initiative rolls; and a 20% chance of spell failure for spells with verbal components. A blinded creature suffers a -4 penalty to its attack rolls; a +4 penalty to its Armor Class; and a +2 penalty to its initiative rolls. 
3,Cure Disease ,Abjuration,Necromantic,Touch,VS,Permanent,1 rd.,1 creature,None,Reversible. This spell enables the caster to cure most diseases by placing his hand upon the diseased creature. The affliction rapidly disappears thereafter; making the cured creature whole and well in from one turn to 10 days; depending on the type of disease and the state of its advancement when the cure took place. (The DM must adjudicate these conditions.) The spell is also effective against parasitic monsters such as green slime; rot grubs; and others. When cast by a priest of at least 12th level; this spell cures lycanthropy if cast within three days of the infection. Note that the spell does not prevent reoccurrence of a disease if the recipient is again exposed. The reverse of the cure disease spell is cause disease. To be effective; the priest must touch the intended victim; and the victim must fail a saving throw vs. spell. The severity of the disease is decided by the priest (debilitating or fatal). The exact details of the disease are decided by the DM; but the following are typical: Debilitating: The disease takes effect in 1d6 turns; after which the creature loses 1 point of Strength per hour until his Strength is reduced to 2 or less; at which time the recipient is weak and virtually helpless. If a creature has no Strength rating; it loses 10% of its hit points per Strength loss; down to 10% of its original hit points. If the disease also affects hit points; use the more severe penalty. Recovery requires a period of 1d3 weeks. Fatal: This wasting disease is effective immediately. Infected creatures receive no benefit from cure wound spells while the disease is in effect; wounds heal at only 10% of the natural rate. The disease proves fatal within 1d6 months and can be cured only by magical means. Each month the disease progresses; the creature loses 2 points of Charisma; permanently. The inflicted disease can be cured by the cure disease spell. Lycanthropy cannot be caused. 
3,Dispel Magic,Abjuration,Protection,60 yds,VS,Special,6,30-ft. cube or 1 item,None,When a priest casts this spell; it has a chance to neutralize or negate the magic it comes in contact with as follows: First; it has a chance to remove spells and spell-like effects (including device effects and innate abilities) from creatures or objects. Second; it may disrupt the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. Third; it may destroy magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell). Each effect or potion in the spell's area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise; the chance depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 11 or higher on 1d20. If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled; the difference is subtracted from this base number needed. If the caster is of lower level; the difference is added to the base. A die roll of 20 always succeeds and a die roll of 1 always fails. Thus; if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel; only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled. A dispel magic can affect only a specially enchanted item (such as a magical scroll; ring; wand; rod; staff; miscellaneous item; weapon; shield; or armor) if it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed or carried by a creature has the creature's saving throw against this effect; otherwise; it is automatically rendered nonoperational. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational is temporarily closed. Note that an item's physical properties are unchanged: A nonoperational magical sword is still a sword. Artifacts and relics are not subject to this spell; but some of their spell-like effects may be; at the DM's option. Note that this spell; if successful; will release charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dispelled; these are listed in the spell descriptions. Summary of Dispel Effects -- Source of Effect / Resists As / Result of Dispel): (Caster / None / Dispel automatic); (Other caster or innate ability / Level or HD of other caster / Effect negated); (Wand / 6th level / Effect negated); (Staff / 8th level / Effect negated); (Potion / 12th level / Potion destroyed); (Other magical item / 12th; unless special / *); (Artifact / DM discretion / DM discretion). * Effect negated; if cast directly on item; item becomes nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. 
3,Feign Death,Necromancy,Necromantic,Touch,V,1 turn + 1 rd./level,2-Jan,Person touched,None,By means of this spell; the caster or any other willing person can be put into a cataleptic state that is impossible to distinguish from actual death. Although the person affected can smell; hear; and know what is going on; no feeling or sight of any sort is possible; thus; any wounding or mistreatment of the body is not felt; no reaction occurs; and damage is only one-half normal. In addition; paralysis; poison; or energy level drain does not affect a person under the influence of this spell; but poison injected or otherwise introduced into the body becomes effective when the spell recipient is no longer under the influence of this spell; although a saving throw is permitted. However; the spell offers no protection from causes of certain death--being crushed under a landslide; etc. Only a willing individual can be affected by a feign death spell. The priest is able to end the spell effect at any time; but it requires a full round for bodily functions to begin again. Note that; unlike the wizard version of this spell; only people can be affected; and that those of any level can be affected by the priest casting this spell. 
3,Flame Walk,Alteration,Elemental (Fire),Touch,VSM,1 rd. + 1/level,5,Creature(s) touched,None,By means of this spell; the caster empowers one or more creatures to withstand nonmagical fires of temperatures up to 2;000 F. (enabling them to walk upon molten lava). It also confers a +2 bonus to saving throws against magical fire and reduces damage from such fires by one-half; even if the saving throw is failed. For every experience level above the minimum required to cast the spell (5th); the priest can affect an additional creature. This spell is not cumulative with resist fire spells or similar protections. The material components of the spell are the priest's holy symbol and at least 500 gp of powdered ruby per affected creature. 
3,Glyph of Warding,Abjuration; Evocation,Guardian,Touch,VSM,Until discharged,Special,Special,Special,A glyph of warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or hostile creatures from passing; entering; or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge; to ward an entry; or as a trap on a chest or box. The priest must set the conditions of the ward; typically any creature violating the warded area without speaking the name of the glyph is subject to the magic it stores. A successful saving throw vs. spell enables the creature to escape the effects of the glyph. Glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics; such as creature type; size; and weight. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good or evil; or to pass those of the caster's religion. They cannot be set according to class; Hit Dice; or level. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area; although if a cabinet had three drawers; each could be separately warded. When the spell is cast; the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. For every 5 square feet of area to be protected; one round is required to trace the warding lines of the glyph. The caster can affect an area equal to a square the sides of which are the same as his level; in feet. The glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of the caster's total square footage. Thus; a 6th-level caster could place a glyph on a 6-foot x 6-foot square; a 4-foot x 9-foot rectangle; a 2-foot x 18- foot band; or a 1-foot by 36-foot strip. When the spell is completed; the glyph and tracery become invisible. The priest traces the glyph with incense; which; if the area exceeds 50 square feet; must be sprinkled with powdered diamond (at least 2;000 gp worth). Typical glyphs shock for 1d4 points of electrical damage per level of the spellcaster; explode for a like amount of fire damage; paralyze; blind; deafen; and so forth. The DM may allow any harmful priest spell effect to be used as a glyph; provided the caster is of sufficient level to cast the spell. Successful saving throws either reduce effects by one- half or negate them; according to the glyph employed. Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing; though they can be dispelled by magic and foiled by high-level thieves using their find-and-remove-traps skill. The DM may decide that the exact glyphs available to a priest depend on his religion; and he might make new glyphs available according to the magical research rules. 
3,Hold Animal,Enchantment/Charm,Animal,80 yds.,VS,2 rds./level,6,1-4 animals in 40-ft. cube,Neg.,By means of this spell; the caster holds one to four animals rigid. Animals affected are normal or giant-sized mammals; birds; or reptiles; but not monsters such as centaurs; gorgons; harpies; naga; etc. Apes; bears; crocodiles; dogs; eagles; foxes; giant beavers; and similar animals are subject to this spell. The hold lasts for two rounds per caster level. The caster decides how many animals can be affected; but the greater the number; the better chance each has to successfully save against the spell. Each animal gets a saving throw: If only one is the subject of the spell; it has a penalty of -4 on its roll; if two are subject; each receives a penalty of -2 on its roll; if three are subject; each receives a penalty of -1 on its roll; and if four are subject; each gets an unmodified saving throw.A maximum body weight of 400 pounds (100 pounds for nonmammals) per animal per caster level can be affected--for example; an 8th-level caster can affect up to four 3;200- pound mammals or a like number of 800-pound nonmammals; such as birds or reptiles. 
3,Locate Object,Divination,Divination,60 yds. + 10 yds./level,VSM,8 hrs.,1 turn,1 object,None,Reversible. This spell helps locate a known or familiar object. The priest casts the spell; slowly turns; and will sense when he is facing in the direction of the object to be located; provided the object is within range--for example; 90 yards for 3rd-level priests; 100 yards for 4th; 110 yards for 5th; etc. The spell locates such objects as apparel; jewelry; furniture; tools; weapons; or even a ladder or stairway. Once the caster has fixed in his mind the items sought; the spell locates only that item. Attempting to find a specific item; such as a kingdom's crown; requires an accurate mental image. If the image is not close enough to the actual item; the spell does not work; in short; desired but unique objects cannot be located by this spell unless they are known by the caster. The spell is blocked by lead. The casting requires the use of a piece of lodestone. The reversal; obscure object; hides an object from location by spell; crystal ball; or similar means for eight hours. The caster must touch the object being concealed. Neither application of the spell affects living creatures. 
3,Magical Vestment,Enchantment,Protection,0,VSM,5 rds./level,1 rd.,The caster,None,This spell enchants the caster's vestment; providing protection at least the equivalent of chain mail (AC 5). The vestment gains a +1 enchantment for each three levels of the priest beyond 5th level; to a maximum of AC 1 at 17th level. The magic lasts for five rounds per level of the caster; or until the caster loses consciousness. If the vestment is worn with other armors; only the best AC (either the armor or the vestment) is used; this protection is not cumulative with any other AC protection. The material components are the vestment to be enchanted and the priest's holy symbol; which are not expended. 
3,Meld Into Stone,Alteration,Elemental (Earth),0,VSM,8 rds. + 1d8 rds.,6,The caster,None,This spell enables the priest to meld his body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate his body in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete; the priest and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated; the spell fails and is wasted. While in the stone; the priest remains in contact; however tenuous; with the face of the stone through which he melded. The priest remains aware of the passage of time. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen or heard; however. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm the priest; but its partial destruction; if enough so that the caster no longer fits; expels the priest with 4d8 points of damage. The stone's destruction expels the priest and slays him instantly; unless he rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell. The magic lasts for 1d8+8 rounds; with the variable part of the duration rolled secretly by the DM. At any time before the duration expires; the priest can step out of the stone through the stone surface he entered. If the duration runs out; or the effect is dispelled before the priest exits the stone; he is violently expelled and suffers 4d8 points of damage. The following spells harm the priest if cast upon the stone that he is occupying: stone to flesh expels the priest and inflicts 4d8 points of damage; stone shape causes 4d4 points of damage; but does not expel the priest; transmute rock to mud expels and slays him instantly unless he rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell; and passwall expels the priest without damage. 
3,Negative Plane Protection ,Abjuration,Protection; Necromantic,Touch,VS,Special,1 rd.,1 creature,None,This spell affords the caster or touched creature partial protection from undead monsters with Negative Energy plane connections (such as shadows; wights; wraiths; spectres; or vampires) and certain weapons and spells that drain energy levels. The negative plane protection spell opens a channel to the Positive Energy plane; possibly offsetting the effect of the negative energy attack. A protected creature struck by a negative energy attack is allowed a saving throw vs. death magic. If successful; the energies cancel with a bright flash of light and a thunderclap. The protected creature suffers only normal hit point damage from the attack and does not suffer any drain of experience or Strength; regardless of the number of levels the attack would have drained. An attacking undead creature suffers 2d6 points of damage from the positive energy; a draining wizard or weapon receives no damage. This protection is proof against only one such attack; dissipating immediately whether or not the saving throw was successful. If the saving throw is failed; the spell recipient suffers double the usual physical damage; in addition to the loss of experience or Strength that normally occurs. The protection lasts for one turn per level of the priest casting the spell; or until the protected creature is struck by a negative energy attack. This spell cannot be cast on the Negative Energy plane. 
3,Plant Growth ,Alteration,Plant,160 yds.,VSM,Permanent,1 rd.,Special,Special,"The plant growth spell enables the caster to choose either of two different uses. The first causes normal vegetation to grow; entwine; and entangle to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through at a movement rate of 10 feet per round (or 20 feet per round for larger-than-man-sized creatures). Note that the area must have brush and trees in it in order for this spell to take effect. Briars; bushes; creepers; lianas; roots; saplings; thistles; thorn; trees; vines; and weeds become so thick and overgrown in the area of effect as to form a barrier. The area of effect is a square 20 feet on a side per level of experience of the caster; in any square or rectangular shape that the caster decides upon at the time of the spellcasting. Thus; an 8th-level caster can affect a maximum area of a 160-foot x 160-foot square; a 320-foot x 80-foot rectangle; a 640-foot x 40-foot rectangle; a 1;280-foot x 20-foot rectangle; etc. The spell's effects persist in the area until it is cleared by labor; fire; or such magical means as a dispel magic spell. The second use of the spell affects a one-mile square area. The DM secretly makes a saving throw (based on the caster's level) to see if the spell takes effect. If successful; the spell renders plants more vigorous; fruitful; and hardy; increasing yields by 20% to 50% ([1d4+1] x 10%); given a normal growing season. The spell does not prevent disaster in the form of floods; drought; fire; or insects; although even in these cases the plants survive better than expected. This effect lasts only for the life cycle of one season; the winter ""death"" marking the end of a life cycle even for the sturdiest of trees. In many farming communities; this spell is normally cast at planting time as part of the spring festivals. "
3,Prayer,Conjuration/Summoning,Combat,0,VSM,1 rd./level,6,60-ft. radius,None,By means of the prayer spell; the priest brings special favor upon himself and his party and causes harm to his enemies. Those in the area at the instant the spell is completed are affected for the duration of the spell. When the spell is completed; all attack and damage rolls and saving throws made by those in the area of effect who are friendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses; while those of the priest's enemies suffer -1 penalties. Once the prayer spell is uttered; the priest can do other things; unlike a chant; which he must continue to make the spell effective. If another priest of the same religious persuasion (not merely the same alignment) is chanting when a prayer is cast; the effects combine to +2 and -2; as long as both are in effect at once. The priest needs a silver holy symbol; prayer beads; or a similar device as the material component of this spell. 
3,Protection From Fire,Abjuration,Protection; Elemental (Fire),Touch,VSM,Special,6,1 creature,None,The effect of a protection from fire spell differs according to whether the recipient of the magic is the caster or some other creature. In either case; the spell lasts no longer than one turn per caster level. If the spell is cast upon the caster; it confers complete invulnerability to: normal fires (torches; bonfires; oil fires; and the like); exposure to magical fires such as fiery dragon breath; spells such as burning hands; fireball; fire seeds; fire storm; flame strike; and meteor swarm; hell hound or pyrohydra breath; etc. The invulnerability lasts until the spell has absorbed 12 points of heat or fire damage per level of the caster; at which time the spell is negated. If the spell is cast upon another creature; it gives invulnerability to normal fire; gives a bonus of +4 to saving throw die rolls vs. fire attacks; and reduces damage sustained from magical fires by 50%. The caster's holy symbol is the material component. 
3,Pyrotechnics,Alteration,Elemental (Fire),160 yds.,VSM,Special,6,10 or 100 (TS) fire,Special,A pyrotechnics spell draws on an existing fire source to produce either of two effects; at the option of the caster. First; it can produce a flashing and fiery burst of glowing; colored aerial fireworks that lasts one round. Creatures in; under; or within 120 feet of the area that have an unobstructed line of sight to the effect are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds unless they roll successful saving throws vs. spell. The fireworks fill a volume 10 times greater than the original fire source. Second; it can cause a thick; writhing stream of smoke to arise from the source and form a choking cloud that lasts for one round per experience level of the caster. This covers a roughly hemispherical volume from the ground or floor up (or conforming to the shape of a confined area) that totally obscures vision beyond 2 feet. The smoke fills a volume 100 times that of the fire source. The spell uses one fire source within the area of effect; which is immediately extinguished. If an extremely large fire is used as the source; it is only partially extinguished by the casting. Magical fires are not extinguished; although a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemental) used as a source suffers 1d4 points of damage; plus 1 point of damage per caster level. This spell does not function under water. 
3,Remove Curse,Abjuration,Protection,Touch,VS,Permanent,6,Special,Special,Reversible. Upon casting this spell; the priest is usually able to remove a curse on an object; on a person; or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the remove curse spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield; weapon; or suit of armor; for example; although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell; or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or more. A caster of 12th level or more can cure lycanthropy with this spell by casting it on the animal form. The were-creature receives a saving throw vs. spell and; if successful; the spell fails and the priest must gain a level before attempting the remedy on this creature again. The reverse of the spell is not permanent; the bestow curse spell lasts for one turn for every experience level of the priest using the spell. The curse can have one of the following effects (roll percentile dice): 50% of the time it reduces one ability of the victim to 3 (the DM randomly determines which ability); 25% of the time it lowers the victim's attack and saving throw rolls by -4; 25% of the time it makes the victim 50% likely to drop whatever he is holding (or do nothing; in the case of creatures not using tools)--roll each round. It is possible for a priest to devise his own curse; and it should be similar in power to those given here. Consult your DM. The subject of a bestow curse spell must be touched. If the victim is touched; a saving throw is still applicable; if it is successful; the effect is negated. The bestowed curse cannot be dispelled. 
3,Remove Paralysis,Abjuration,Protection,10 yds./level,VS,Permanent,6,1d4 creatures in 20-ft. cube,None,By the use of this spell; the priest can free one or more creatures from the effects of any paralyzation or from related magic (such as a ghoul touch; or a hold or slow spell). If the spell is cast on one creature; the paralyzation is negated. If cast on two creatures; each receives another saving throw vs. the effect that afflicts it; with a +4 bonus. If cast on three or four creatures; each receives another saving throw with a +2 bonus. There must be no physical or magical barrier between the caster and the creatures to be affected; or the spell fails and is wasted. 
3,Snare,Enchantment/Charm,Plant,Touch,VSM,Until triggered,3 rds.,2-ft. diameter + 2 in./level,None,This spell enables the caster to make a snare that is 90% undetectable without magical aid. The snare can be made from any supple vine; a thong; or a rope. When the snare spell is cast upon it; the cordlike object blends with its surroundings. One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle (note that the head of a worm or snake could be thus ensnared). If a strong and supple tree is nearby; the snare can be fastened to it. The magic of the spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered; inflicting 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped; and lifting it off the ground by the trapped member(s) (or strangling it if the head/neck triggered the snare). If no such sapling or tree is available; the cordlike object tightens upon the member(s); then wraps around the entire creature; causing no damage; but tightly binding it. Under water; the cord coils back upon its anchor point. The snare is magical; so for one hour it is breakable only by cloud giant or greater Strength (23); each hour thereafter; the snare material loses magic so as to become 1 point more breakable per hour--22 after two hours; 21 after three; 20 after four--until six full hours have elapsed. At that time; 18 Strength will break the bonds. After 12 hours have elapsed; the materials of the snare lose all magical properties and the loop opens; freeing anything it held. The snare can be cut with any magical weapon; or with any edged weapon wielded with at least a +2 attack bonus (from Strength; for example). The caster must have a snake skin and a piece of sinew from a strong animal to weave into the cordlike object from which he will make the snare. Only the caster's holy symbol is otherwise needed. 
3,Speak With Dead,Necromancy,Divination,1,VSM,Special,1 turn,1 creature,Special,Upon casting a speak with dead spell; the priest is able to ask several questions of a dead creature in a set period of time and receive answers according to the knowledge of that creature. Of course; the priest must be able to converse in the language that the dead creature once used. The length of time the creature has been dead is a factor; since only higher level priests can converse with a long-dead creature. The number of questions that can be answered and the length of time in which the questions can be asked depend on the level of experience of the priest. Even if the casting is successful; such creatures are as evasive as possible when questioned. The dead tend to give extremely brief and limited answers; often cryptic; and to take questions literally. Furthermore; their knowledge is often limited to what they knew in life. A dead creature of different alignment or of higher level or Hit Dice than the caster's level receives a saving throw vs. spell. A dead creature that successfully saves can refuse to answer questions; ending the spell. At the DM's option; the casting of this spell on a given creature might be restricted to once per week. The priest needs a holy symbol and burning incense in order to cast this spell upon the body; remains; or a portion thereof. The remains are not expended. This spell does not function under water. (Caster's Level of Experience / Max. Length of Time Dead / Time Questioned / No. of Questions): (1-7 / 1 week / 1 round / 2); (7-8 / 1 month / 3 rounds / 3); (9-12 / 1 year / 1 turn / 4); (13-15 / 10 years / 2 turns / 5); (16-20 / 100 years / 3 turns / 6); (21+ / 1;000 years / 1 hour / 7).
3,Spike Growth,Alteration; Enchantment,Plant,60 yds.,VSM,3d4 turns + 1/level,6,10-ft. sq./level,None,Wherever any type of plant growth of moderate size or density is found; this spell can be used. The ground-covering vegetation or roots and rootlets in the area becomes very hard and sharply pointed. In effect; the ground cover; while appearing to be unchanged; acts as if the area were strewn with caltrops. In areas of bare ground or earthen pits; roots and rootlets act in the same way. For each 10 feet of movement through the area; the victim suffers 2d4 points of damage. He must also roll a saving throw vs. spell. If this saving throw is failed; the victim's movement rate is reduced by 1/3 of its current total (but a creature's movement rate can never be less than 1). This penalty lasts for 24 hours; after which the character's normal movement rate is regained. Without the use of a spell such as true seeing; similar magical aids; or some other special means of detection (such as detect traps or detect snares and pits); an area affected by spike growth is absolutely undetectable as such until a victim enters the area and suffers damage. Even then; the creature cannot determine the extent of the perilous area unless some means of magical detection is used. The components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol and either seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs; each sharpened to a point. 
3,Starshine,Evocation; Illusion/Phantasm,Sun,10 yds./level,VSM,1 turn/level,6,10-ft. sq./level,None,"A starshine spell enables the caster to softly illuminate an area as if it were exposed to a clear night sky filled with stars. Regardless of the height of the open area in which the spell is cast; the area immediately beneath it is lit by starshine. Vision ranges are the same as those for a bright moonlit night--movement noted out to 100 yards; stationary creatures seen up to 50 yards; general identifications made at 30 yards; and recognition at 10 yards. The spell creates shadows and has no effect on infravision. The area of effect actually appears to be a night sky; but disbelief of the illusion merely enables the disbeliever to note that the ""stars"" are actually evoked lights. This spell does not function under water. The material components are several stalks from an amaryllis plant (especially Hypoxis) and several holly berries. "
3,Stone Shape,Alteration,Elemental (Earth),Touch,VSM,Permanent,1 rd.,9 cu. ft. + 1 cu. ft./level,None,By means of this spell; the caster can form an existing piece of stone into any shape that suits his purposes. For example; he can make a stone weapon; a special trapdoor; or a crude idol. By the same token; it enables the spellcaster to shape a stone door; perhaps so as to escape imprisonment; providing the volume of stone involved is within the limits of the area of effect. While stone coffers can be thus formed; stone doors made; etc.; the fineness of detail is not great. If the shaping has moving parts; there is a 30% chance they do not work. The material component of this spell is soft clay that must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object; and then touched to the stone when the spell is uttered. 
3,Summon Insects,Conjuration/Summoning,Animal,30 yds.,VSM,1 rd./level,1 rd.,1 creature,None,The summon insects spell attracts a cloud or swarm of normal insects to attack the foes of the caster. Flying insects appear 70% of the time; while crawling insects appear 30% of the time. The exact insects called are bees; biting flies; hornets; or wasps; if flying insects are indicated; biting ants or pinching beetles; if crawling insects are indicated. A cloud of the flying type; or a swarm of the crawling sort; appears after the spell is cast. This gathers at a point chosen by the caster; within the spell's range; and attacks any single creature the caster points to. The attacked creature sustains 2 points of damage if it does nothing but attempt to flee or fend off the insects during the time it is attacked; it suffers 4 points of damage per round otherwise. If the insects are ignored; the victim fights with a -2 penalty to his attack roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor Class. If he attempts to cast a spell; an initiative roll should be made for the insects to see if their damage occurs before the spell is cast. If it does; the victim's concentration is ruined and the spell is lost. The insects disperse and the spell ends if the victim enters thick smoke or hot flames. Besides being driven off by smoke or hot flames; the swarm might possibly be outrun; or evaded by plunging into a sufficient body of water. If evaded; the summoned insects can be sent against another opponent; but there will be at least a 1 round delay while they leave the former opponent and attack the new victim. Crawling insects can travel only about 10 feet per round (maximum speed over smooth ground) and flying insects travel 60 feet per round. The caster must concentrate to maintain the swarm; it dissipates if he moves or is disturbed. It is possible; in underground situations; that the caster might summon 1d4 giant ants by means of the spell; but the possibility is only 30% unless giant ants are nearby. This spell does not function under water. The materials needed for this spell are the caster's holy symbol; a flower petal; and a bit of mud or wet clay. 
3,Tree,Alteration,Plant,0,VSM,6 turns + 1 turn/level,6,The caster,None,By means of this spell; the caster is able to assume the form of a small living tree or shrub or that of a large dead tree trunk with only a few limbs. Although the closest inspection cannot reveal that this plant is actually a person; and for all normal tests he is; in fact; a tree or shrub; the caster is able to observe all that goes on around him just as if he were in normal form. The Armor Class and hit points of the plant are those of the caster. The caster can remove the spell at any time; instantly changing from plant to his normal form and having full capability for any action normally possible (including spellcasting). Note that all clothing and gear worn or carried change with the caster. Tåçhe material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a twig from a tree. 
3,Water Breathing,Alteration,Elemental (Water; Air),Touch,VS,1 hr./level,6,1 creature,None,Reversible. The recipient of a water breathing spell is able to breathe under water freely for the duration of the spell--i.e.; one hour for each experience level of the caster. The priest can divide the base duration between multiple characters. Thus; an 8th-level priest can confer this ability to two characters for four hours; four for two hours; eight for one hour; etc.; to a minimum of one half-hour per character. The reverse; air breathing; enables water-breathing creatures to survive comfortably in the atmosphere for an equal duration. Note that neither version prevents the recipient creature from breathing in its natural element. 
3,Water Walk ,Alteration,Elemental (Water),Touch,VSM,1 turn + 1 turn/level,6,Special,None,By means of this spell; the caster is able to empower one or more creatures to tread upon any liquid as if it were firm ground; this includes mud; quicksand; oil; running water; and snow. The recipient's feet do not touch the surface of the liquid; but oval depressions of his appropriate foot size and 2 inches deep are left in the mud or snow. The recipient's rate of movement remains normal. If cast under water; the recipient is borne toward the surface. For every level of the caster above the minimum required to cast the spell (5th level); he can affect another creature. The material components for this spell are a piece of cork and the priest's holy symbol. 
4,Abjure,Abjuration,Summoning,10 yds.,VSM,Special,1 rd.,1 creature,Special,This spell can send an extraplanar creature back to its own plane of existence. The spell fails against entities of demigod status or greater; but their servants or minions can be abjured. If the creature has a specific (proper) name; it must be known and used. Any magic resistance of the subject must be overcome; or the spell fails. The priest has a 50% chance of success (a roll of 11 or better on 1d20). The roll is adjusted by the difference in level or Hit Dice between the caster and the creature being abjured; the number needed is decreased if the priest has more Hit Dice and increased if the creature has more Hit Dice. If the spell is successful; the creature is instantly hurled back to its own plane. The affected creature must survive a system shock check. If the creature does not have a Constitution score; the required roll is 70% + 2%/Hit Die or level. The caster has no control over where in the creature's plane the abjured creature arrives. If the attempt fails; the priest must gain another level before another attempt can be made on that particular creature. The spell requires the priest's holy symbol; holy water; and some material inimical to the creature. 
4,Animal Summoning I,Conjuration; Summoning,Animal; Summoning,1 mi. radius,VS,Special,7,Special,None,By means of this spell; the caster calls up to eight animals that have 4 Hit Dice or less; of whatever sort the caster names when the summoning is made. Only animals within range of the caster at the time the spell is cast will come. The caster can try three times to summon three different types of animals. For example; a caster first tries to summon wild dogs to no avail; then unsuccessfully tries to call hawks; and finally calls wild horses that may or may not be within summoning range. The DM must determine the chance of a summoned animal type being within the range of the spell. The animals summoned aid the caster by whatever means they possess; staying until a fight is over; a specific mission is finished; the caster is safe; he sends them away; etc. Only normal or giant animals can be summoned; fantastic animals or monsters cannot be summoned by this spell (no chimerae; dragons; gorgons; manticores; etc.). 
4,Call Woodland Beings,Conjuration/Summoning,Summoning,100 yds./level,VSM,Special,Special,Special,Neg.,By means of this spell; the caster is able to summon certain woodland creatures to his location. Naturally; this spell works only outdoors; but not necessarily only in wooded areas. The caster begins the incantation and continues uninterrupted until some called creature appears or two turns have elapsed. (The verbalization and somatic gesturing are easy; so this is not particularly exhausting to the spellcaster.) Only one type of the following sorts of beings can be summoned by the spell. They come only if they are within the range of the call. The caster can call three times; for a different type each time. Once a call is successful; no other type can be called without another casting of the spell. (The DM will consult his outdoor map or base the probability of any such creature being within spell range upon the nature of the area the caster is in at the time of spellcasting.) The creature(s) called by the spell are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell (with a -4 penalty) to avoid the summons. Any woodland beings answering the call are favorably disposed to the spellcaster and give whatever aid they are capable of. However; if the caller or members of the caller's party are of evil alignment; the creatures are entitled to another saving throw vs. spell (this time with a +4 bonus) when they come within 10 yards of the caster or another evil character with him. These beings immediately seek to escape if their saving throws are successful. In any event; if the caster requests that the summoned creatures engage in combat on his behalf; they are required to roll a loyalty reaction check based on the caster's Charisma and whatever dealings he has had with them. This spell works with respect to neutral or good woodland creatures; as determined by the DM. Thus; the DM can freely add to or alter the list as he sees fit. If the caster personally knows a certain individual woodland being; that being can be summoned at double the normal range. If this is done; no other woodland creatures are affected. If a percentage chance is given in the accompanying table; druids and other nature- based priests add 1% per caster level. These chances can be used if no other campaign information on the area is available. The material components of this spell are a pine cone and eight holly berries. (Creature Type Called / Light Woodland / Moderate or Sylvan Woodland / Dense or Virgin Woodland): (2d8 brownies / 30% / 20% / 10%); (1d4 centaurs / 5% / 30% / 5%); (1d4 dryads / 1% / 25% / 10%); (1d8 pixies / 10% / 20% / 10%); (1d4 satyrs / 1% / 30% / 10%); (1d6 sprites / 0% / 5% / 25%); (1 treant / NIL / 5% / 25%); (1 unicorn / NIL / 15% / 20%).
4,Cloak of Bravery,Conjuration/Summoning,Charm,Touch,VSM,Special,6,1 creature,Neg.,Reversible. The cloak of bravery spell can be cast upon any willing creature. The protected individual gains a bonus to his saving throw against any form of fear encountered (but not awe--an ability of some lesser and greater powers). When cast; the spell can affect one to four creatures (caster's choice). If only one is affected; the saving throw bonus is +4. If two are affected; the bonus is +3; and so forth; until four creatures are protected by a +1 bonus. The magic of the cloak of bravery spell works only once and then the spell ends; whether or not the creature's saving throw is successful. The spell ends after eight hours if no saving throw is required before then. The reverse of this spell; cloak of fear; empowers a single creature touched to radiate a personal aura of fear; at will; out to a 3-foot radius. All other characters and creatures within this aura must roll successful saving throws vs. spell or run away in panic for 2d8 rounds. Affected individuals may or may not drop items; at the DM's option. The spell has no effect upon undead of any sort. The effect can be used only once; and the spell expires after eight hours if not brought down sooner. Members of the recipient's party are not immune to the effects of the spell. The material component for the cloak of bravery spell is the feather of an eagle or hawk. The reverse requires the tail feathers of a vulture or chicken. 
4,Control Temperature; 10' Radius,Alteration,Weather,0,VSM,4 turns + 1 turn/level,7,10-ft. radius,None,When this spell is cast; the temperature surrounding the caster can be altered by 10 F.; either upward or downward; per level of experience of the spellcaster. Thus; a 10th-level caster could raise or lower the surrounding temperature from 1 to 100 degrees. The spell can be used to ensure the comfort of the caster and those with him in extreme weather conditions. The party could stand about in shirt sleeves during the worst blizzard (although it would be raining on them) or make ice for their drinks during a scorching heat wave. The spell also provides protection from intense normal and magical attacks. If the extreme of temperature is beyond what could be affected by the spell (a searing blast of a fireball or the icy chill of a white dragon); the spell reduces the damage caused by 5 points for every level of the caster. Normal saving throws are still allowed; and the reduction is taken after the saving throw is made or failed. Once struck by such an attack; the spell immediately collapses. The material component for this spell is a strip of willow bark (to lower temperatures) or raspberry leaves (to raise temperatures). 
4,Cure Serious Wounds,Necromancy,Healing,Touch,VS,Permanent,7,1 creature,None,Reversible. This spell is a more potent version of the cure light wounds spell. When laying his hand upon a creature; the priest heals 2d8+1 points of wound or other injury damage to the creature's body. This healing cannot affect noncorporeal; nonliving; or extraplanar creatures. Cause serious wounds; the reverse of the spell; operates similarly to the cause light wounds spell; the victim having to be touched first. If the touch is successful; 2d8+1 points of damage are inflicted. 
4,Detect Lie,Divination,Divination,30 yds.,VSM,1 rd./level,7,1 creature,Neg.,Reversible. A priest who casts this spell is immediately able to determine if the subject creature deliberately and knowingly speaks a lie. It does not reveal the truth; uncover unintentional inaccuracies; or necessarily reveal evasions. The subject receives a saving throw vs. spell; which is adjusted only by the Wisdom of the caster--for example; if the caster has a Wisdom of 18; the subject's saving throw roll is reduced by 4 (see Table 5: Wisdom). The material component for the detect lie spell is one gp worth of gold dust. The spell's reverse; undetectable lie; prevents the magical detection of lies spoken by the creature for 24 hours. The reverse requires brass dust as its material component. 
4,Divination,Divination,Divination,0,VSM,Special,1 turn,Special,None,"A divination spell is used to garner a useful piece of advice concerning a specific goal; event; or activity that will occur within a one-week period. This can be as simple as a short phrase; or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. Unlike the augury spell; this gives a specific piece of advice. For example; if the question is ""Will we do well if we venture to the third level?"" and a terrible troll guarding 10;000 gp and a shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the level (the DM estimates the party could beat the troll after a hard fight); the divination response might be: ""Ready oil and open flame light your way to wealth."" In all cases; the DM controls what information is received and whether additional divinations will supply additional information. Note that if the information is not acted upon; the conditions probably change so that the information is no longer useful (in the example; the troll might move away and take the treasure with it). The base chance for a correct divination is 60%; plus 1% for each experience level of the priest casting the spell. The DM makes adjustments to this base chance considering the actions being divined (if; for example; unusual precautions against the spell have been taken). If the dice roll is failed; the caster knows the spell failed; unless specific magic yielding false information is at work. The material components of the divination spell are a sacrificial offering; incense; and the holy symbol of the priest. If an unusually important divination is attempted; sacrifice of particularly valuable gems; jewelry; or magical items may be required. "
4,Free Action,Abjuration; Enchantment,Charm,Touch,VSM,1 turn/level,7,1 creature,None,This spell enables the creature touched to move and attack normally for the duration of the spell; even under the influence of magic that impedes movement (such as web or slow spells) or while under water. It even negates or prevents the effects of paralysis and hold spells. Under water; the individual moves at normal (surface) speed and inflicts full damage; even with such cutting weapons as axes and swords and with such smashing weapons as flails; hammers; and maces; provided that the weapon is wielded in the hand rather than hurled. The free action spell does not; however; allow water breathing without further appropriate magic. The material component is a leather thong; bound around the arm or similar appendage; which disintegrates when the spell expires. 
4,Giant Insect,Alteration,Animal,20 yds.,VSM,Permanent,7,1 to 6 insects,None,"Reversible. By means of this spell; the priest can turn one or more normal-sized insects into larger forms resembling the giant insects described in the Monstrous Manual. Only one type of insect can be altered at one time (i.e.; a single casting cannot affect both an ant and a fly) and all insects affected must be grown to the same size. The number of insects and the size to which they can be grown depends upon the priest's level -- (Priest's Level / Insect Hit Dice / Maximum Total HD): (7-9 / 3 / 9); (10-12 / 4 / 12); (13+ / 6 / 15). For example; an 8th-level priest can grow three insects to 3 Hit Dice; four insects to 2 Hit Dice; or nine insects to 1 Hit Die. Flying insects of 3 Hit Dice or more can carry a rider of human size (assume that such can carry 80 pounds per Hit Die). If the casting is interrupted for any reason; or if the insects are currently subject to any other magical effect (including this one); the insects die and the spell is ruined. The DM decides how many normal insects of what type are available; this is often a greater limitation on the spell than the limits above. If the insect created by this spell matches an existing monster description; use the monster description. Otherwise; unless the DM creates a special description; the giant form has an Armor Class of between 8 and 4; one attack; and inflicts 1d4 points of damage per Hit Die. For example; a 14th-level priest uses the giant insect spell to enlarge one beetle (all that is available) to 6 HD size. The DM decides the beetle has AC 5 and bites once for 6d4 points of damage. Note that the spell works only on actual insects. Arachnids; crustaceans; and other types of small creatures are not affected. Any giant insects created by this spell do not attempt to harm the priest; but the priest's control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (""attack;"" ""defend;"" ""guard;"" and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex. Unless commanded to do otherwise; the giant insects attempt to attack whoever or whatever is near them. The reverse of the spell; shrink insect; reduces any giant insect to normal insect size. The number of Hit Dice affected by the priest is subtracted from the number of Hit Dice of the insects; and any insect reduced to 0 Hit Dice has been shrunk. Partial shrinking is ignored; an insect is either shrunk or unaffected. Thus; a 9th-level priest attacked by giant ants could shrink three warrior ants or four worker ants to normal insect size with no saving throw. This spell has no effect on intelligent insectlike creatures. The priest must use his holy symbol for either version of the spell. "
4,Hallucinatory Forest,Illusion/Phantasm,Plant,80 yds.,VS,Permanent,7,40-ft. sq./level,None,Reversible. When this spell is cast; a hallucinatory forest comes into existence. The illusionary forest appears to be perfectly natural and is indistinguishable from a real forest. Priests attuned to the woodlands--as well as such creatures as centaurs; dryads; green dragons; nymphs; satyrs; and treants--recognize the forest for what it is. All other creatures believe it is there; and movement and order of march are affected accordingly. Touching the illusory growth neither affects the magic nor reveals its nature. The hallucinatory forest remains until it is magically dispelled by a reverse of the spell or a dispel magic spell. The area shape is either roughly rectangular or square; in general; and at least 40 feet deep; in whatever location the caster desires. The forest can be of less than maximum area if the caster wishes. One of its edges can appear up to 80 yards away from the caster. 
4,Hold Plant,Enchantment/Charm,Plant,80 yds.,VS,1 rd./level,7,1d4 plants in 40-ft. sq.,Neg.,The hold plant spell affects vegetable matter as follows: 1) it causes ambulatory vegetation to cease moving; 2) it prevents vegetable matter from entwining; grasping; closing; or growing; 3) it prevents vegetable matter from making any sound or movement that is not caused by wind. The spell effects apply to all forms of vegetation; including parasitic and fungoid types; and those magically animated or otherwise magically empowered. It affects such monsters as green slime; molds of any sort; shambling mounds; shriekers; treants; etc. The duration of a hold plant spell is one round per level of experience of the caster. It affects 1d4 plants in a 40-foot x 40-foot area; or a square 4 to 16 yards on a side of small ground growth such as grass or mold. If only one plant (or 4 yards square) is chosen as the target for the spell by the caster; the saving throw of the plant (or area of plant growth) is made with a -4 penalty to the die roll; if two plants (or 8 yards square) are the target; saving throws suffer a -2 penalty; if three plants (or 12 yards square) are the target; saving throws suffer a -1 penalty; and if the maximum of four plants (or 16 yards square) are the target; saving throws are unmodified. 
4,Imbue With Spell Ability,Enchantment,Charm,Touch,VSM,Until used,1 turn,Person touched,None,By the use of this spell; the priest can transfer a limited number and selection of his currently memorized spells; and the ability to cast them; to another person. Only nonspellcasters (including rangers under 8th level and paladins under 9th level) can receive this bestowal; the imbue with spell ability enchantment does not function for those belonging to spellcasting classes; for unintelligent monsters; nor for any individual with less than 1 full Hit Die. In addition; the person thus imbued must have a Wisdom score of 9 or higher. Only priest spells of an informational or defensive nature or a cure light wounds spell can be transferred. Transferring any other spell type negates the entire attempt; including any allowable spells that were chosen. Higher level persons can receive more than one spell at the priest's option -- (Level of Recipient / Spells Imbued): (1 / One 1st-level spell); (3 / Two 1st-level spells); (5+ / Two 1st- and one 2nd-level spells). The transferred spell's variable characteristics (range; duration; area of effect; etc.) function according to the level of the priest originally imbuing the spell. A priest who casts imbue with spell ability upon another character loses the number of 1st- and 2nd-level spells he has imbued until the recipient uses the transferred spells or is slain. For example; a 7th-level priest with five 1st- and four 2nd-level spells imbues a 10th-level fighter with a cure light wounds spell and a slow poison spell. The cleric now can have only four 1st-level spells memorized until the cure is cast and only three 2nd- level spells until the slow poison is cast; or until the fighter is killed. In the meantime; the priest remains responsible to his ethos for the use to which the spell is put. The material components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol; plus some minor item from the recipient that is symbolic of his profession (a lockpick for a thief; etc.). This item; and any material component for the imbued spell; is consumed when the imbue with spell ability spell is cast. 
4,Lower Water,Alteration,Elemental (Water),120 yds.,VSM,1 turn/level,1 turn,Special,None,Reversible. The lower water spell causes water or similar fluid in the area of effect to sink away to a minimum depth of 1 inch. The depth can be lowered by up to 2 feet for every experience level of the priest. The water is lowered within a square area whose sides are 10 feet long per caster level. Thus; an 8th-level priest affects a volume up to 16 feet x 80 feet x 80 feet; a 9th-level caster affects a volume up to 18 feet x 90 feet x 90 feet; and so on. In extremely large and deep bodies of water; such as deep ocean; the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward; putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures; this spell acts as a slow spell: The creature moves at half speed and makes half its usual number of attacks each round. The spell has no effect on other creatures. Its reverse; raise water; causes water or similar fluids to return to their highest natural level: spring flood; high tide; etc. This can make fords impassable; float grounded ships; and may even sweep away bridges at the DM's option. It negates lower water and vice versa. The material components of this spell are the priest's holy (or unholy) symbol and a pinch of dust. 
4,Neutralize Poison,Necromancy,Healing,Touch,VS,Permanent,7,1 creature or 1 cu. ft. of substance/2 levels,None,Reversible. By means of a neutralize poison spell; the priest detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or substance touched. Note that an opponent; such as a poisonous reptile or snake (or even an envenomed weapon of an opponent) unwilling to be so touched requires the priest to roll a successful attack in combat. This spell can prevent death in a poisoned creature if cast before death occurs. The effects of the spell are permanent only with respect to poison existing in the touched creature at the time of the touch; thus; creatures (and objects) that generate new poison are not permanently detoxified. The reversed spell; poison; likewise requires a successful attack roll; and the victim is allowed a saving throw vs. poison. If the latter is unsuccessful; the victim is incapacitated and dies in one turn unless the poison is magically neutralized or slowed. 
4,Plant Door,Alteration,Plant,Touch,VSM,Special,7,Special,None,The plant door spell opens a magical portal or passageway through trees; undergrowth; thickets; or any similar growth--even growth of a magical nature. The plant door is open to the caster who cast the spell; casters of a higher level; or dryads; others must be shown the location of the door. The door even enables the caster to enter a solid tree trunk and remain hidden there until the spell ends. The spell also enables the passage or hiding of any man-sized or smaller creature; hiding is subject to space considerations. If the tree is cut down or burned; those within must leave before the tree falls or is consumed; or else they are killed also. The duration of the spell is one turn per level of experience of the caster. If the caster opts to stay within an oak; the spell lasts nine times longer than normal; if within an ash tree; it lasts three times longer. The path created by the spell is up to 4 feet wide; 8 feet high; and 12 feet long per level of experience of the caster. This spell does not function on plant-based monsters (shambling mounds; molds; slimes; treants; etc.). The material components for this spell are a piece of charcoal and the caster's holy symbol. 
4,Produce Fire,Alteration,Elemental (Fire),40 yds.,VSM,1 rd.,7,12-ft. sq.,None,Reversible. By means of this spell; the caster creates a common fire of up to 12 feet per side in area. Though it lasts only a single round (unless it ignites additional flammable material); the fire produced by the spell inflicts 1d4 points of damage plus 1 point per caster level (1d4 + 1/level) upon creatures within its area. It ignites combustible materials; such as cloth; oil; paper; parchment; wood; and the like; so as to cause continued burning. The reverse; quench fire; extinguishes any normal fire (coals; oil; tallow; wax; wood; etc.) within the area of effect. The material component for either version is a paste of sulfur and wax; formed into a ball and thrown at the target. 
4,Protection From Evil; 10' Radius,Abjuration,Protection,Touch,VSM,1 turn/level,7,10-ft. radius,None,Reversible. The globe of protection of this spell is identical in all respects to that of a protection from evil spell; except that it encompasses a much larger area and its duration is greater. The effect is centered on and moves with the creature touched. Any protected creature within the circle will break the warding against enchanted/summoned monsters if he attacks those monsters. A creature unable to fit completely into the area of effect (for example; a 21-foot-tall titan) remains partially exposed and subject to whatever penalties the DM decides. If such a creature is the recipient of the spell; the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only. The reverse; protection from good; 10’ radius; wards against good creatures. To complete this spell; the priest must trace a circle 20 feet in diameter using holy (or unholy) water and incense (or smoldering dung); according to the protection from evil spell. 
4,Protection From Lightning,Abjuration,Protection; Weather,Touch,VSM,Special,7,1 creature,None,The effect of a protection from lightning spell changes depending on who is the recipient of the magic--the caster or some other creature. In either case; the spell lasts no longer than one turn per caster level. If the spell is cast upon the caster; it confers complete invulnerability to electrical attack such as dragon breath; or magical lightning such as lightning bolt; shocking grasp; storm giant; will 'o wisp; etc.; until the spell has absorbed 10 points of electrical damage per level of the caster; at which time the spell is negated. If the spell is cast upon another creature; it gives a bonus of +4 to the die roll for saving throws made vs. electrical attacks; and it reduces the damage sustained from such attacks by 50%. The caster's holy symbol is the material component. 
4,Reflecting Pool,Divination,Divination,10 yds.,VSM,1 rd./level,2 hrs.,Special,None,This spell enables the caster to cause a pool of normal water found in a natural setting to act as a scrying device. The pool can be of no greater diameter than 2 feet per level of the caster. The effect is to create a scrying device similar to a crystal ball. The scrying can extend only to the Ethereal Plane and the Inner Planes (which includes the paraelemental planes; the Demiplane of Shadow; etc.). General notes on scrying; detection by the subject; and penalties for attempting to scry beyond the caster's own plane are given in the DMG; as well as a description of the crystal ball item. The following spells can be cast through a reflecting pool; with a 5% per level chance for operating correctly: detect magic; detect snares and pits; and detect poison. Each additional detection attempt requires a round of concentration; regardless of success. Infravision; if available; operates normally through the reflecting pool. The image is nearly always hazy enough to prevent the reading of script of any type. The material component is the oil extracted from such nuts as the hickory and the walnut; refined; and dropped in three measures upon the surface of the pool. (A measure need be no more than a single ounce of oil.) At the DM's option; the casting of this spell may be limited to once per day. 
4,Repel Insects,Abjuration; Alteration,Animal; Protection,0,VSM,1 turn/level,1 rd.,10-ft. radius,None,When this spell is cast; the priest creates an invisible barrier to all sorts of insects; and normal insects do not approach within 10 feet of the caster while the spell is in effect. Giant insects with Hit Dice less than 1/3 of the caster's experience level are also repelled (for example; 2 Hit Dice for 7th- to 9th-level casters; 3 Hit Dice at 10th through 12th level; etc.). Insects with more Hit Dice can enter the protected area if the insect is especially aggressive and; in addition; rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell. Those that do sustain 1d6 points of damage from passing through the magical barrier. Note that the spell does not in any way affect arachnids; myriapods; and similar creatures--it affects only true insects. The material components of the repel insects spell include any one of the following: several crushed marigold flowers; a whole crushed leek; seven crushed stinging nettle leaves; or a small lump of resin from a camphor tree. 
4,Speak With Plants,Alteration,Plant,0,VSM,1 rd./level,1 turn,30-ft. radius,None,When cast; a speak with plants spell enables the priest to converse; in very rudimentary terms; with all sorts of living vegetables (including fungi; molds; and plantlike monsters; such as shambling mounds) and to exercise limited control over normal plants (i.e.; not monsters or plantlike creatures). Thus; the caster can question plants as to whether or not creatures have passed through them; cause thickets to part to enable easy passage; require vines to entangle pursuers; and command similar services. The spell does not enable plants to uproot themselves and move about; but any movements within the plants' normal capabilities are possible. Creatures entangled by the 1st-level spell of that name can be released. The power of the spell lasts for one round for each experience level of the casting priest. All vegetation within the area of effect is affected by the spell. The material components for this spell are a drop of water; a pinch of dung; and a flame. 
4,Spell Immunity,Abjuration,Protection,Touch,VSM,1 turn/level,1 rd.,1 creature,None,By means of this spell; the priest renders a creature touched immune to the effects of a specified spell of 4th level or lower. It protects against spells; spell-like effects of magical items; and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against breath weapons or gaze attacks of any type. The spell has several additional limitations. First; the caster must have directly experienced the effect of the specified spell. For example; if the caster has been attacked by a fireball spell at some time; he can use the spell immunity spell to provide protection from a fireball. Second; the spell cannot affect a creature already magically protected by a potion; protective spell; ring; or other device. Third; only a particular spell can be protected against; not a certain sphere of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect; thus; a creature given immunity to the lightning bolt spell is still vulnerable to a shocking grasp spell. The material component for spell immunity is the same as that for the spell to be protected against. 
4,Sticks to Snakes,Alteration,Plant,30 yds.,VSM,2 rds./level,7,1d4 sticks + 1 stick/level in a 10-ft. cube,None,Reversible. By means of this spell; the caster can change 1d4 sticks; plus one stick per experience level; into snakes; thus; a 9th-level priest can change 10-13 sticks into an equal number of snakes. These snakes attack as commanded by the priest. There must; of course; be sticks or similar pieces of wood (such as torches; spears; etc.) to turn into snakes. Such a stick cannot be larger than a staff. Sticks held by creatures are allowed a saving throw equal to that of the possessor (i.e.; a spear held by an orc must roll the orc's saving throw vs. polymorph). Magical items; such as staves and enchanted spears; are not affected by the spell. Only sticks within the area of effect are changed. The type of snake created varies; but a typical specimen has 2 Hit Dice; Armor Class 6; a movement rate of 9; and either constricts for 1d4+1 points of damage per round or bites for 1 point plus poison (if any). The chance of a snake thus changed being venomous is 5% per caster level; if the spellcaster desires. Thus; an 11th-level priest has a maximum 55% chance that any snake created by the spell is poisonous. The spell lasts for two rounds for each experience level of the spellcaster. The material components of the spell are a small piece of bark and several snake scales. The reverse spell changes normal-sized snakes to sticks for the same duration; or it negates the sticks to snakes spell according to the level of the priest countering the spell (for example; a 10th-level priest casting the reverse spell can turn 11-14 snakes back into sticks). 
4,Tongues ,Alteration,Divination,0,VS,1 turn,7,The caster,None,Reversible. This spell enables the caster to speak and understand additional languages; whether they are racial tongues or regional dialects; but not communications of animals or mindless creatures. When the spell is cast; the spellcaster selects the language or languages to be understood. The spell then empowers the caster with the ability to speak and understand the language desired with perfect fluency and accent. The spell enables the priest to be understood by all speakers of that language within hearing distance; usually 60 feet. This spell does not predispose the subject toward the caster in any way. The priest can speak one additional tongue for every three levels of experience. The reverse of the spell cancels the effect of the tongues spell or confuses verbal communication of any sort within the area of effect. 
5,Air Walk ,Alteration,Elemental (Air),Touch,VSM,1 hour + 1 turn/level,8,1 creature,None,This spell enables a creature; which can be as big as the largest giant; to tread upon air as if it were walking on solid ground. Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. A maximum upward angle of 45 degrees is possible at one-half the creature's movement rate; as is a maximum downward angle of 45 degrees at the normal movement rate. An air-walking creature is in control of its movement; except when a strong wind is blowing. In this case; the creature gains or loses 10 feet of movement for every 10 miles per hour of wind velocity. The creature can; at the DM's option; be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds; such as loss of control of movement or suffering physical damage. The spell can be placed upon a trained mount; so it can be ridden through the air. Of course; a mount not accustomed to such movement would certainly need careful and lengthy training; the details for which are up to the DM. The material components for the spell are the priest's holy symbol and a bit of thistledown. 
5,Animal Growth ,Alteration,Animal,80 yds.,VSM,2 rds./level,8,Up to 8 animals in a 20-ft. sq.,None,Reversible. When this spell is released; the caster causes up to eight animals within a 20-foot- square area to grow to twice their normal size. The effects of this growth are doubled Hit Dice (with resultant improvement in attack potential); doubled hit points (except hit points added to Hit Dice); and doubled damage in combat. Movement and AC are not affected. The spell lasts for two rounds for each level of the caster. The spell is particularly useful in conjunction with a charm person or mammal spell. The reverse reduces animal size by one-half; and likewise reduces Hit Dice; hit points; attack damage; etc. The material component for this spell and its reverse is the caster's holy symbol and a scrap of food. 
5,Animal Summoning II,Conjuration/Summoning,Animal; Summoning,60 yds./level,VS,Special,8,Special,None,By means of this spell; the caster calls up to six animals of 8 Hit Dice or less; or 12 animals of 4 Hit Dice or less--of whatever sort the caster names. Only animals within range of the caster at the time the spell is cast will come. The caster can try three times to summon three different types of animals. For example; suppose that wild dogs are first summoned to no avail; then hawks are unsuccessfully called; and finally the caster calls for wild horses. The DM determines the chance of a summoned animal type being within range of the spell. The animals summoned aid the caster by whatever means they possess; staying until a fight is over; a specific mission is finished; the caster is safe; he sends them away; etc. Only normal or giant animals can be summoned; fantastic animals or monsters cannot be effected by this spell (no chimerae; dragons; gorgons; manticores; etc.). 
5,Antiplant Shell,Abjuration,Plant; Protection,0,VS,1 turn/level,8,15-ft. diameter,None,The anti-plant shell spell creates an invisible; mobile barrier that keeps all creatures within the shell protected from attacking plants or vegetable creatures such as shambling mounds or treants. Any attempt to force the barrier against such creatures shatters the barrier immediately. The spell lasts for one turn for each experience level of the caster. 
5,Atonement,Abjuration,All,Touch,VSM,Permanent,1 turn,1 person,None,This spell is used by the priest to remove the burden of unwilling or unknown deeds from the person who is the subject of the atonement. The spell removes the effects of magical alignment changes as well. The person seeking the atonement spell must either be truly repentant or not have been in command of his own will when the acts to be atoned for were committed. The DM will judge this spell in this regard; noting any past instances of its use upon the person. Deliberate misdeeds and acts of knowing and willful nature cannot be atoned for with this spell (see the quest spell). A character who refuses to accept an atonement is automatically considered to have committed a willful misdeed. The priest needs his religious symbol; prayer beads or wheel or book; and burning incense. 
5,Commune ,Divination,Divination,0,VSM,Special,1 turn,Special,None,"By use of a commune spell; the priest is able to contact his deity--or agents thereof-- and request information in the form of questions that can be answered by a simple ""yes"" or ""no."" The priest is allowed one such question for every experience level he has attained. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. ""I don't know"" is a legitimate answer; as powerful outer planar beings ar not necessarily omniscient. Optionally; the DM may give a single short answer of five words or less. The spell will; at best; provide information to aid character decisions. Entities communed with structure their answers to further their own purposes. It is probable that the DM will limit the use of commune spells to one per adventure; one per week; or even one per month; for the greater powers dislike frequent interruptions. Likewise; if the caster lags; discusses the answers; or goes off to do anything else; the spell immediately ends. The material components necessary for a commune spell are the priest's religious symbol; holy (unholy) water; and incense. If a particularly potent commune is needed; a sacrifice proportionate with the difficulty of obtaining the information is required. If the offering is insufficient; no information or only partial information is gained. "
5,Commune With Nature,Divination,Divination; Elemental,0,VS,Special,1 turn,Special,None,"This spell enables the caster to become one with nature; thus being empowered with knowledge of the surrounding territory. For each level of experience of the caster; he can ""know"" one fact--ahead; left; or right; about the following subjects: the ground; plants; minerals; bodies of water; people; general animal population; presence of woodland creatures; etc. The presence of powerful unnatural creatures also can be detected; as can the general state of the natural setting. The spell is most effective in outdoor settings; operating in a radius of one-half mile for each level of the caster. In natural underground settings--caves; cavern; etc.--the range is limited to 10 yards per caster level. In constructed settings (dungeons and towns); the spell will not function. The DM may limit the casting of this spell to once per month. "
5,Control Winds,Alteration,Weather,0,VS,1 turn/level,8,40-ft./level radius,None,"By means of a control winds spell; the caster is able to alter wind force in the area of effect. For every three levels of experience; the caster can increase or decrease wind force by one level of strength. Wind strengths are as follows -- (Wind Force / Miles Per Hour): (Light Breeze / 2-7); (Moderate Breeze / 8-18); (Strong Breeze / 19-31); (Gale / 32-54); (Storm / 55-72); (Hurricane / 73-176). Winds in excess of 19 miles per hour drive small flying creatures--those eagle-sized and under--from the skies; severely affect missile accuracy; and make sailing difficult. Winds in excess of 32 miles per hour drive even man-sized flying creatures from the skies and cause minor ship damage. Winds in excess of 55 miles per hour drive all flying creatures from the skies; uproot small trees; knock down wooden structures; tear off roofs; and endanger ships. Winds in excess of 73 miles per hour are of hurricane force. An ""eye"" of 40-foot radius; in which the wind is calm; exists around the caster. Note that while the spell can be used underground; if the spell is cast in an area smaller than the area of effect; the eye shrinks 1 foot for every foot of confinement. For example; if the area of effect is a 360-foot area; the eye shrinks by 10 feet to a 30-foot radius; a space under 320 feet in a radius would eliminate the eye and subject the spellcaster to the effects of the wind. Once the spell is cast; the wind force increases or decreases by 3 miles per hour per round until the maximum or minimum speed is attained. The caster; with one round of complete concentration; can stabilize the wind at its current strength; or set it to increase or decrease. However; the rate of the change cannot be altered. The spell remains in force for one turn for each level of experience of the caster. When the spell is exhausted; the force of the wind wanes or waxes at the same rate; until it reaches the level it was at before the spell took effect. Another caster can use a control winds spell to counter the effects of a like spell up to the limits of his own ability. "
5,Cure Critical Wounds,Necromancy,Healing,Touch,VS,Permanent,8,1 creature,None,Reversible. The cure critical wounds spell is a very potent version of the cure light wounds spell. The priest lays his hand upon a creature and heals 3d8+3 points of damage from wounds or other damage. The spell does not affect creatures without corporeal bodies; those of extraplanar origin; or those not living. The reversed spell; cause critical wounds; operates in the same fashion as other causes wounds spells; requiring a successful touch to inflict the 3d8+3 points of damage. Caused wounds heal via the same methods as do wounds of other sorts. 
5,Dispel Evil ,Abjuration,Protection; Summoning,Touch,VSM,1 rd./level,8,1 creature,Neg.,Reversible. The priest using this spell causes a summoned creature of evil nature; an evil creature from another plane; or a creature summoned by an evil caster; to return to its own plane or place when the caster successfully strikes it in melee combat. Examples of such creatures are aerial servants; djinn; efreet; elementals; and invisible stalkers. An evil enchantment (such as a charm spell cast by an evil creature) that is subject to a normal dispel magic spell can be automatically dispelled by the dispel evil spell. This spell lasts for a maximum of one round for each experience level of the caster; or until expended. While the spell is in effect; all creatures that could be affected by it fight with a -7 penalty to their attack rolls when engaging the spellcaster. The reverse of the spell; dispel good; functions against summoned or enchanted creatures of good alignment or creatures that have been sent to aid the cause of good. The material components for this spell are the priest's religious object and holy (or unholy) water. 
5,Flame Strike,Evocation,Combat,60 yds.,VSM,Instantaneous,8,5 ft. radius x 30 ft. column,2-Jan,When the priest evokes a flame strike spell; a vertical column of fire roars downward in the location called for by the caster. Any creatures within the area of effect must roll a saving throw vs. spell. Failure means the creature sustains 6d8 points of damage; otherwise; the damage is halved. The material component of this spell is a pinch of sulphur. 
5,Insect Plague,Conjuration/Summoning,Combat,120 yds.,VSM,2 rds./level,1 turn,180 ft. x 60 ft. cloud,None,When this spell is cast by the priest; a horde of creeping; hopping; and flying insects gather and swarm in a thick cloud. In an environment free of normal insects; the spell fails. The insects obscure vision; limiting it to 10 feet. Spellcasting within the cloud is impossible. Creatures in the insect plague; regardless of Armor Class; sustain 1 point of damage for each round they remain within; due to the bites and stings of the insects. Invisibility is no protection. All creatures with 2 or fewer Hit Dice will automatically move at their fastest possible speed in a random direction until they are more than 240 yards away from the insects. Creatures with fewer than 5 Hit Dice must check morale; failure means they run as described above. Heavy smoke drives off insects within its bounds. Fire also drives insects away. For example; a wall of fire in a ring shape keeps a subsequently cast insect plague outside its confines; but a fireball spell simply clears insects from its blast area for one round. A single torch is ineffective against this vast horde of insects. Lightning; cold; or ice are likewise ineffective; while a strong wind that covers the entire plague area disperses the insects and ends the spell. The plague lasts two rounds for each level of the caster; and thereafter the insects disperse. The insects swarm in an area that centers around a summoning point determined by the spellcaster. The point can be up to 120 yards away from the priest. The insect plague does not move thereafter for as long as it lasts. Note that the spell can be countered by a dispel magic spell. The material components of this spell are a few granules of sugar; some kernels of grain; and a smear of fat. 
5,Magic Font,Divination,Divination,Touch,VSM,Special,1 hour,Special,None,The spell causes a holy water font to serve as a scrying device. The spell does not function unless the priest is in good standing with his deity. The basin of holy water becomes similar to a crystal ball. For each vial of capacity of the basin; the priest may scry for one round; up to a maximum of one hour. Thus; the duration of the magic font spell is directly related to the size of the holy water receptacle. The DM will know the chances of a character being able to detect scrying. The priest's holy symbol and the font and its trappings are not consumed by the spell. 
5,Moonbeam,Evocation; Alteration,Sun,60 yds. + 10 yds./level,VSM,1 rd./level,7,5 ft. radius + special,None,By means of this spell; the caster is able to cause a beam of soft; pale light to strike down from overhead and illuminate whatever area he is pointing at. The light is exactly the same as moonlight; so that colors other than shades of black; gray; or white are vague. The spellcaster can easily make the moonbeam move to any area that he can see and point to. This makes the spell an effective way to spotlight something; an opponent; for example. While the moonbeam spell does not eliminate all shadows; a creature centered in a moonbeam is most certainly visible. The reflected light from this spell enables dim visual perception 10 yards beyond the area of effect; but it does not shed a telltale glow that would negate surprise. The light does not adversely affect infravision. The caster can dim the beam to near darkness if desired. The beam has; in addition; all the properties of true moonlight and can induce a lycanthropic change (of a creature in the beam); unless the DM rules otherwise. The material components are several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar (moonstone). 
5,Pass Plant,Alteration,Plant,Touch,VSM,Special,8,Special,None,By using this spell; the caster is able to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree. The second tree must lie in approximately the direction desired by the spell user and must be within the range shown in the following table. (Type of Tree / Range of Area of Effect): (Oak / 600 yards); (Ash / 540 yards); (Yew / 480 yards); (Elm / 420 yards); (Linden / 360 yards); (deciduous / 300 yards); (coniferous / 240 yards); (other / 180 yards). The tree entered and that receiving the caster must be of the same type; must both be living; and of girth at least equal to that of the caster. Note that if the caster enters a tree; an ash; for example; and wishes to pass north as far as possible (540 yards); but the only appropriate ash in range is to the south; the caster will pass to the ash in the south. The pass plant spell functions so that the movement takes only one round. The caster can; at his option; remain within the receiving tree for a maximum of one round per level of experience. Otherwise; he can step forth immediately. Should no like tree be in range; the caster simply remains within the first tree; does not pass elsewhere; and must step forth in the appropriate number of rounds. If the occupied tree is chopped down or burned; the caster is slain if he does not exit before the process is complete. 
5,Plane Shift,Alteration,Astral,Touch,VSM,Permanent,8,1 creature (special),Neg.,When the plane shift spell is cast; the priest moves himself or some other creature to another plane of existence. The recipient of the spell remains in the new plane until sent forth by some like means. If several persons link hands in a circle; up to eight can be affected by the plane shift at the same time. The material component of this spell is a small; forked metal rod. The size and metal type dictates to which plane of existence; including sub-planes and alternate dimensions; the spell sends the affected creatures. The DM will determine specifics regarding how and what planes are reached. An unwilling victim must be touched (successful attack roll) to be sent. In addition; the creature is also allowed a saving throw. If the saving throw is successful; the effect of the spell is negated. Note that pinpoint accuracy is rarely achieved; arriving at a random distance from an intended destination is common. The metal rod is not expended when the spell is cast. Forked rods keyed to certain planes may be difficult to come by; as decided by the DM. 
5,Quest ,Enchantment/Charm,Charm,60 yds.,VSM,Until fulfilled,8,1 creature,Neg.,The quest spell enables the priest to require the affected creature to perform a service and return to the priest with proof that the deed was accomplished. The quest can; for example; require that the creature locate and return some important or valuable object; rescue a notable person; release some creature; capture a stronghold; slay a person; deliver some item; and so forth. If the quest is not properly followed; due to disregard; delay; or perversion; the creature affected by the spell loses 1 from its saving throw rolls for each day of such action. This penalty is not removed until the quest is properly pursued or the priest cancels it. There are certain circumstances that will temporarily suspend a quest; and others that will discharge or cancel it. The DM will give you appropriate information as the need to know arises. If cast upon an unwilling subject; the victim is allowed a saving throw. However; if the person quested agrees to a task--even if the agreement is gained by force or trickery--no saving throw is allowed. If a quest is just and deserved; a creature of the priest's religion cannot avoid it; and any creature of the priest's alignment saves with a -4 penalty to the saving throw. A quest cannot be dispelled; but it can be removed by a priest of the same religion or of higher level than the caster. Some artifacts and relics might negate the spell; as can direct intervention by a deity. Likewise; an unjust or undeserved quest grants bonuses to saving throws; or might even automatically fail. The material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol. 
5,Rainbow ,Evocation; Alteration,Weather; Sun,120 yds.,VSM,1 rd./level,7,Special,None,To cast this spell; the priest must be in sight of a rainbow; or have a special component (see below). The rainbow spell has two applications; and the priest can choose the desired one at the time of casting. These applications are as follows: -- Bow: The spell creates a shimmering; multi-layered short composite bow of rainbow hues. It is light and easy to pull; so that any character can use it without penalty for non- proficiency. It is magical: Each of its shimmering missiles is the equivalent of a +2 weapon; including attack and damage bonuses. Magic resistance can negate the effect of any missile fired from the bow. The bow fires seven missiles before disappearing. It can be fired up to four times per round. Each time a missile is fired; one hue leaves the bow; corresponding to the color of arrow that is released. Each color of arrow has the ability to cause double damage to certain creatures; as follows -- (Color / Creature Type): (Red / fire dwellers/users and fire elementals); (Orange / creatures or constructs of clay; sand; earth; stone or similar materials; and earth elementals); (Yellow / vegetable opponents (including fungus creatures; shambling mounds; treants; etc.); (Green / aquatic creatures; electricity-using creatures; and air elementals); (Indigo / acid-using or poison-using creatures); (Violet / metallic or regenerating creatures). When the bow is drawn; an arrow of the appropriate color magically appears; nocked and ready. If no color is requested; or a color that has already been used is asked for; then the next arrow (in the order of the spectrum) appears. -- Bridge: The caster causes the rainbow to form a seven-hued bridge up to 3 feet wide per level of the caster. It must be at least 20 feet long and can be as long as 120 yards; according to the caster's desire. It lasts as long as the spell's duration or until ordered out of existence by the caster. The components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a vial of holy water. If no rainbow is in the vicinity; the caster can substitute a diamond of not less than 1;000 gp value; specially prepared with bless and prayer spells while in sight of a rainbow. The holy water and diamond disappear when the spell is cast. 
5,Raise Dead ,Necromancy,Necromantic,30 yds.,VS,Permanent,1 rd.,1 person,Special,Reversible: When the priest casts a raise dead spell; he can restore life to a dwarf; gnome; half-elf; halfling; or human (other creatures may be allowed; at the DM's option). The length of time that the person has been dead is of importance; as the priest can raise persons dead only up to a limit of one day for each experience level of the priest (i.e.; a 9th-level priest can raise a person who has been dead for up to nine days). Note that the body of the person must be whole; or otherwise missing parts are still missing when the person is brought back to life. Likewise; other ills; such as poison and disease; are not negated. The raised person must roll a successful resurrection survival check to survive the ordeal (see Table 3: Constitution) and loses 1 point of Constitution. Further; the raised person is weak and helpless; needing a minimum of one full day of rest in bed for each day or fraction he was dead. The person has 1 hit point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic. A character's starting Constitution is an absolute limit to the number of times he can be revived by this means. The somatic component of the spell is a pointed finger. The reverse of the spell; slay living; grants the victim a saving throw vs. death magic. If the saving throw is successful; the victim sustains damage equal to that of a cause serious wounds spell--i.e.; 2d8+1 points. Failure means the victim dies instantly. 
5,Spike Stones ,Alteration; Enchantment,Elemental (Earth),30 yds.,VSM,3d4 turns +1/level,6,10 ft. sq./level;,None,The spike stones spell causes rock to shape itself into long; sharp points that tend to blend into the background. It is effective on both natural rock and worked stone. The spike stones serve to impede progress through an area and to inflict damage. If an area is carefully observed; each observer is 25% likely to notice the sharp points of rock. Otherwise; those entering the spell's area of effect suffer 1d4 points of damage per round. The success of each attack is determined as if the caster of the spell were actually engaging in combat. Those entering the area are subject to attack immediately upon setting foot in the area and for each round spent in the area thereafter. The initial step enables the individual to become aware of some problem only if the initial attack succeeds; otherwise movement continues and the spike stones remain unnoticed until damage occurs. Charging or running victims suffer two attacks per round. Those falling into pits affected by spike stones suffer six such attacks for every 10 feet fallen; each attack having a +2 bonus to the attack roll. In addition; the damage inflicted by each attack increases by +2 for every 10 feet fallen. Finally; the creatures also suffer normal falling damage. The material component of this spell is four tiny stalactites. 
5,Transmute Rock to Mud,Alteration,Elemental (Earth; Water),160 yds.,VSM,Special,8,20-ft. cube/level,None,Reversible. This spell turns natural rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud. If it is cast upon a rock; for example; the rock affected collapses into mud. Magical or enchanted stone is not affected by the spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. Creatures unable to levitate; fly; or otherwise free themselves from the mud sink at the rate of 1/3 of their height per round and eventually suffocate; save for lightweight creatures that could normally pass across such ground. Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it; with the amount required decided by the DM. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can move through the area at a rate of 10 feet per round. The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance--but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt at a rate of 1d6 days per 10 cubic feet. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun; wind; and normal drainage. The reverse; transmute mud to rock; hardens normal mud or quicksand into soft stone (sandstone or similar mineral) permanently unless magically changed. Creatures in the mud are allowed a saving throw to escape before the area is hardened to stone. Dry sand is unaffected. The material components for the spell are clay and water (or sand; lime; and water for the reverse). 
5,True Seeing,Divination,Divination,Touch,VSM,1 rd./level,8,1 creature,None,Reversible. When the priest employs this spell; he confers upon the recipient the ability to see all things as they actually are. The spell penetrates normal and magical darkness. Secret doors become plain. The exact location of displaced things is obvious. Invisible things become quite visible. Illusions and apparitions are seen through. Polymorphed; changed; or enchanted things are apparent. Even the aura projected by creatures becomes visible; so that alignment can be discerned. Further; the recipient can focus his vision to see into the Ethereal plane or the bordering areas of adjacent planes. The range of vision conferred is 120 feet. True seeing; however; does not penetrate solid objects; it in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. In addition; the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic. The spell requires an ointment for the eyes that is made from very rare mushroom powder; saffron; and fat and costs no less than 300 gp per use. The reverse; false seeing; causes the person to see things as they are not: rich is poor; rough is smooth; beautiful is ugly. The ointment for the reverse spell is concocted of oil; poppy dust; and pink orchid essence. For both spells; the ointment must be aged for 1d6 months. 
5,Wall of Fire ,Conjuration/Summoning,Elemental (Fire),80 yds.,VSM,Special,8,Special,None,The wall of fire spell brings forth an immobile; blazing curtain of magical fire of shimmering color--yellow-green or amber (different from the 4th-level wizard version). The spell creates an opaque sheet of flame up to one 20-foot square per level of the spellcaster; or a ring with a radius of up to 10 feet + 5 feet for every two levels of experience of the wizard; and 20 feet high. The wall of fire must be cast so that it is vertical with respect to the caster. One side of the wall; selected by the caster; sends forth waves of heat; inflicting 2d4 points of damage upon creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of damage upon those within 20 feet. In addition; the wall inflicts 4d4 points of damage; plus 1 point of damage per level of the spellcaster; to any creature passing through it. Creatures especially subject to fire may take additional damage; and undead always take twice normal damage. Note that attempting to directly catch moving creatures with a newly created wall of fire is difficult. A successful saving throw enables the creature to avoid the wall; while its rate and direction of movement determine which side of the created wall it is on. The wall of fire lasts as long as the priest concentrates on maintaining it; or one round per level of experience of the priest in the event he does not wish to concentrate upon it. The material component of the spell is phosphorus. 
6,Aerial Servant,Conjuration/Summoning,Summoning,10 yds.,VS,1 day/level,9,Special,None,This spell summons an invisible aerial servant to find and bring back an object or creature described to it by the priest. Unlike an elemental; an aerial servant cannot be commanded to fight for the caster. When it is summoned; the priest must have cast a protection from evil spell; be within a protective circle; or have a special item used to control the aerial servant. Otherwise; it attempts to slay its summoner and return from whence it came. The object or creature to be brought must be such as to allow the aerial servant to physically bring it to the priest (an aerial servant can carry at least 1;000 pounds). If prevented; for any reason; from completing the assigned duty; the aerial servant returns to its own plane whenever the spell lapses; its duty is fulfilled; it is dispelled; the priest releases it; or the priest is slain. The spell lasts for a maximum of one day for each level of experience of the priest who cast it. If the creature to be fetched cannot detect invisible objects; the aerial servant attacks; automatically gaining surprise. If the creature involved can detect invisible objects; it still suffers a -2 penalty to all surprise rolls caused by the aerial servant. Each round of combat; the aerial servant must roll to attack. When a hit is scored; the aerial servant has grabbed the item or creature it was sent for. A creature with a Strength rating is allowed an evasion roll; equal to twice its [pi]bend bars[xpi] chance; to escape the hold. If the creature in question does not have a Strength rating; roll 1d8 for each Hit Die the aerial servant and the creature grabbed have. The higher total is the stronger. Once seized; the creature cannot free itself by Strength or Dexterity and is flown to the priest forthwith. 
6,Animal Summoning III,Conjuration; Summoning,Animal; Summoning,100 yds./level,VS,Special,9,Special,None,This spell is the same in duration and effect as the 4th-level animal summoning I spell; except that up to four animals of no more than 16 Hit Dice each can be summoned; or eight of no more than 8 Hit Dice; or 16 creatures of no more than 4 Hit Dice. Only animals within range of the caster at the time the spell is cast will come. The caster can try three times to summon three different types of animals[md]e.g.; suppose that wild dogs are first summoned to no avail; then hawks are unsuccessfully called; and finally the caster calls for wild horses that may or may not be within summoning range. Your DM will determine the chance of a summoned animal type being within range of the spell. The animals summoned will aid the caster by whatever means they possess; staying until a fight is over; a specific mission is finished; the caster is safe; he sends them away; etc. Only normal or giant animals can be summoned; fantastic animals or monsters cannot be summoned by this spell (no chimerae; dragons; gorgons; manticores; etc.). 
6,Animate Object,Alteration,Creation; Summoning,30 yds.,VS,1 rd./level,9,1 cu. ft./level,None,This powerful spell enables the priest casting it to imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. The animated object; or objects; then attacks whomever or whatever the priest first designates. The animated object can be of any nonmagical material whatsoever such as wood; metal; stone; fabric; leather; ceramic; glass; etc. Attempting to animate an object in someone's possession grants that person a saving throw to prevent the spell's effect. The speed of movement of the object depends on its means of propulsion and its weight. A large wooden table would be rather heavy; but its legs would give it speed. A rug could only slither along. A jar would roll. Thus a large stone pedestal would rock forward at 10 feet per round; a stone statue would move at 40 feet per round; a wooden statue 80 feet per round; an ivory stool of light weight would move at 120 feet per round. Slithering movement is about 10 feet to 20 feet per round; rolling is 30 feet to 60 feet per round. The damage caused by the attack of an animated object depends on its form and composition. Light; supple objects can only obscure vision; obstruct movement; bind; trip; smother; etc. Light; hard objects can fall upon or otherwise strike for 1d2 points of damage or possibly obstruct and trip; as do light; supple objects. Hard; medium-weight objects can crush or strike for 2d4 points of damage; while larger and heavier objects may inflict 3d4; 4d4; or even 5d4 points of damage. The frequency of attack of animated objects depends on their method of locomotion; appendages; and method of attack. This varies from as seldom as once every five melee rounds to as frequently as once per round. The Armor Class of the object per round. The Armor Class of the object animated is basically a function of material and movement ability. Damage depends on the type of weapon is effective against fabric; leather; wood; and like substances. Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are useful against wood; stone; and metal objects. Your DM will determine all of these factors; as well as how much damage the animated object can sustain before being destroyed. The priest can animate one cubic foot of material for each experience level he has attained. Thus; a 14th-level priest could animate one or more objects whose solid volume did not exceed 14 cubic feet[md]a large statue; two rugs; three chairs; or a dozen average crocks. 
6,Antianimal Shell,Abjuration,Animal; Protection,0,VSM,1 turn/level,1 rd.,10-ft. radius,None,By casting this spell; the caster brings into being a hemispherical force field that prevents the entrance of any sort of living creature that is wholly or partially animal (not magical or extraplanar). Thus a sprite; a giant; or a chimera would be kept out; but undead or conjured creatures could pass through the shell of force; as could such monsters as aerial servants; imps; quasits; golems; elementals; etc. The anti-animal shell functions normally against crossbreeds; such as cambions; and lasts for one turn for each level of experience the caster has attained. Forcing the barrier against creatures strains and ultimately collapses the field. The spell requires the caster's holy symbol and a handful of pepper. 
6,Blade Barrier,Evocation,Guardian; Creation,30 yds.,VS,3 rds./level,9,5-60 ft. sq.,Special,The priest employs this spell to set up a wall of circling; razor-sharp blades. These whirl and flash around a central point; creating an immobile barrier. Any creature attempting to pass through the blade barrier suffers 8d8 points of damage. The plane of rotation of the blades can be horizontal; vertical; or in between. Creatures within the area of the barrier when it is invoked are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. If this is successful; the blades are avoided and no damage is suffered; the creature escapes the area of the blade barrier by the shortest possible route. The barrier remains for three rounds for every experience level of the priest casting it. The barrier can cover an area from as small as 5 feet square to as large as 60 feet square. 
6,Conjure Animals,Conjuration/Summoning,Summoning,30 yds.,VS,2 rds./level,9,Special,None,The conjure animals spell enables the priest to magically create one or more mammals to attack his opponents. The total Hit Dice of the mammals cannot exceed twice his level; if the creature conjured is determined randomly. If a specific animal type is requested; the animal's Hit Dice cannot exceed his level. The DM selects the type of animal that appears if it is randomly called. Thus; a priest of 12th level could randomly conjure two mammals with 12 Hit Dice each; four with 6 Hit Dice each; six with 4 Hit Dice each; eight with 3 Hit Dice each; 12 with 2 Hit Dice each; or 24 with 1 Hit Die each. Count every +1 hit point added to a creature's Hit Dice as 1/2 of a Hit Die. Thus a creature with 4 + 3 Hit Dice equals a 41/2 Hit Dice creature. The conjured animals remain for two rounds for conjured animals remain for two rounds for each level of the conjuring priest; or until slain; and they follow the caster's verbal commands. Conjured animals unfailingly attack the priest's opponents; but resist being used for any other purpose--they do not like it; become noticeably more difficult to control; and may refuse any action; break free; or turn on the caster; depending on the nature of the creature and the details of the situation. The conjured animals disappear when slain. 
6,Conjure Fire Elemental,Conjuration/Summoning,Elemental (Fire),80 yds.,VS,1 turn/level,6 rds.,Special,None,Reversible. Upon casting a conjure fire elemental spell; the caster opens a special gate to the elemental plane of Fire; and a fire elemental is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcaster. It is 65% likely that a 12 Hit Dice elemental appears; 20% likely that a 16 Hit Dice elemental appears; 9% likely that two to four salamanders appear; 4% likely that an efreeti appears; and 2% likely that a huge fire elemental of 21 to 24 Hit Dice appears. The caster need not fear that the elemental force summoned will turn on him; so concentration upon the activities of the fire elemental (or other creatures summoned) or protection from the creature is not necessary. The elemental summoned helps the caster however possible; including attacking the caster's opponents. The fire elemental or other creature summoned remains for a maximum of one turn per level of the caster; or until it is slain; sent back by a dispel magic spell; the reverse of this spell; dismiss fire elemental; or similar magic. 
6,Find the Path,Divination,Divination,Touch,VSM,1 turn/level,3 rds.,1 creature,None,"The recipient of this spell can find the shortest; most direct physical route that he is seeking; be it the way into or out of a locale. The locale can be outdoors or under ground; a trap; or even a maze spell. Note that the spell works with respect to locales; not objects or creatures within a locale. Thus; the spell could not find the way to ""a forest where a green dragon lives"" or to the location of ""a hoard of platinum pieces."" The location must be in the same plane as the caster. The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead him to his destination; indicating at the appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example; with concentration the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a glyph. The spell ends when the destination is reached or when one turn for each caster level has elapsed. The spell frees the subject; and those with him; from a maze spell in a single round; and will continue to do so as long as the spell lasts. Note that this divination is keyed to the caster; not his companions; and that; like the find traps spell; it does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures. The spell requires a set of divination counters of the sort favored by the priest--bones; ivory counters; sticks; carved runes; or whatever. The reverse spell; lose the path; makes the creature touched totally lost and unable to find its way for the duration of the spell--although it can be led; of course. "
6,Fire Seeds,Conjuration,Elemental (Fire),Touch,VSM,Special,1 rd./seed,Special,2-Jan,The fire seeds spell creates special missiles or timed incendiaries that burn with great heat. The spell can be cast to create either fire seed missiles or fire seed incendiaries; as chosen when the spell is cast. Fire seed missiles: This casting turns up to four acorns into special grenadelike missiles that can be hurled up to 40 yards. An attack roll is required to strike the intended target; and proficiency penalties are considered. Each acorn bursts upon striking any hard surface; causing 2d8 points of damage and igniting any combustible materials within a 10-foot diameter of the point of impact. If a successful saving throw vs. spell is made; a creature within the burst area receives only one-half damage; but a creature struck directly suffers full damage (i.e.; no saving throw). Fire seed incendiaries: This casting turns up to eight holly berries into special incendiaries. The holly berries are most often placed; being too light to make effective missiles. They can be tossed only up to 6 feet away. They burst into flame if the caster is within 40 yards and speaks a word of command. The berries instantly ignite; causing 1d8 points of damage to any creature and igniting any combustible within a 5-foot-diameter burst area. Creatures within the area that successfully save vs. spell suffer half damage. All fire seeds lose their power after a duration equal to one turn per experience level of the caster--e.g.; the seeds of a 13th-level caster remain potent for a maximum of 13 turns after their creation. No other material components beyond acorns or holly berries are needed for this spell. 
6,Forbiddance,Abjuration,Protection,30 yds.,VSM,Permanent,6 rds.,60-ft. cube/level,Special,This spell can be used to secure a consecrated area (see the Dungeon Master Guide). The spell seals the area from teleportation; plane shifting; and ethereal penetration. At the option of the caster; the ward can be locked by a password; in which case it can be entered only by those speaking the proper words. Otherwise; the effect on those entering the enchanted area is based on their alignment; relative to the caster's. The most severe penalty is used. Alignment identical: No effect. If password locked; cannot enter area unless password is known (no saving throw). Alignment different with respect to law and chaos: Save vs. spell to enter the area; if failed; suffer 2d6 points of damage. If password locked; cannot enter unless password is known. Alignment different with respect to good and evil: Save vs. spell to enter this area; if failed; suffer 4d6 points of damage. If word locked; cannot enter unless password is known. The attempt does cause damage if the save is failed. Once a saving throw is failed; an intruder cannot enter the forbidden area until the spell ceases. The ward cannot be dispelled by a caster of lesser level than the one who established it. Intruders who enter by rolling successful saving throws feel uneasy and tense; despite their success. In addition to the priest's holy symbol; components include holy water and rare incenses worth at least 1;000 gp per 60-foot cube. If a password lock is desired; this also requires the burning of rare incenses worth at least 5;000 gp per 60-foot cube. 
6,Heal,Necromancy,Healing,Touch,VS,Permanent,1 rd.,1 creature,None,Reversible. The very potent heal spell enables the priest to wipe away disease and injury in the creature who receives the benefits of the spell. It completely cures all diseases or blindness of the recipient and heals all points of damage suffered due to wounds or injury. It dispels a feeblemind spell. It cures those mental disorders caused by spells or injury to the brain. Naturally; the effects can be negated by later wounds; injuries; and diseases. The reverse; harm; infects the victim with a disease and causes loss of all but 1d4 hit points; if a successful touch is inflicted. For creatures that are not affected by the heal or harm spell; see the cure light wounds spell. 
6,Heroes' Feast,Evocation,Creation,10 yds.,VSM,1 hour,1 turn,1 feaster/level,None,This spell enables the priest to bring forth a great feast that serves as many creatures as the priest has levels of experience. The spell creates a magnificent table; chairs; service; and all the necessary food and drink. The feast takes one full hour to consume; and the beneficial effects do not set in until after this hour is over. Those partaking of the feast are cured of all diseases; are immune to poison for 12 hours; and are healed of 1d4+4 points of damage after imbibing the nectarlike beverage that is part of the feast. The ambrosialike food that is consumed is equal to a bless spell that lasts for 12 hours. Also; during this same period; the people who consumed the feast are immune to fear; hopelessness; and panic. If the feast is interrupted for any reason; the spell is ruined and all effects of the spell are negated. The material components of the spell are the priest's holy symbol and specially fermented honey taken from the cells of bee larvae destined for royal status. 
6,Liveoak,Enchantment,Plant,Touch,VSM,1 day/level,1 turn,1 oak tree,None,"This spell enables the caster to charm a healthy oak tree (or other type if the DM allows) to cause it to serve as a protector. The spell can be cast on a single tree at a time. While a liveoak spell cast by a particular caster is in effect; he cannot cast another such spell. The tree upon which the spell is cast must be within 10 feet of the caster's dwelling place; within a place sacred to the caster; or within 100 yards of something that the caster wishes to guard or protect. The liveoak spell can be cast upon a healthy tree of small; medium; or large size; according to desire and availability. A triggering phrase of up to maximum of one word per level of the spellcaster is then placed upon the targeted oak. For instance; ""Attack any persons who come near without first saying sacred mistletoe"" is an 11-word trigger phrase that could be used by a caster of 11th level or higher casting the spell. The liveoak spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant of equivalent size; an Armor Class of 0 and with two attacks per round; but with only a 30-feet-per-round movement rate. (Tree Size / Height / Hit Dice / Damage per Attack): (Small / 12' - 14' / 7-8 / 2d8); (Medium / 16' - 19' / 9-10 / 3d6); (Large / 20' - 23'+ / 11-12 / 4d6). A tree enchanted by this spell radiates a magical aura (if checked for); and can be returned to normal by a successful casting of a dispel magic spell; or upon the desire of the caster who enchanted it. If dispelled; the tree takes root immediately. If released by the caster; it tries to return to its original location before taking root. Damage to the tree can be healed with a plant growth spell; which restores 3d4 points of damage. A plant growth spell used in this fashion does not increase the size or hit points of the liveoak beyond the original value. The caster needs his holy symbol to cast this spell. "
6,Part Water,Alteration,Elemental (Water),20 yds./level,VSM,1 turn/level,1 turn,3 ft./level x 20 yds./level x 30 yds.,None,By employing a part water spell; the priest is able to cause water or similar liquid to move apart; thus forming a trough. The depth and length of the trough created by the spell depends on the level of the priest. A trough 3 feet deep per caster level; by 30 yards wide; by 20 yards long per level is created. Thus at 12th level; the priest would part water 36 feet deep by 30 yards wide by 240 yards long. The trough remains as long as the spell lasts or until the priest who cast it opts to end its effects. Existing currents appear to flow through the parted water; although swimming creatures and physical objects such as boats do not enter the rift without strenuous and deliberate effort. If cast underwater; this spell creates an air cylinder of appropriate length and diameter. If cast directly on a water elemental or other water-based creature; the creature suffers 48 points of damage and must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or flee in panic for 3d4 rounds. The material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol. 
6,Speak With Monsters,Alteration,Divination,30 yds.,VS,2 rd./level,9,The caster,None,When cast; the speak with monsters spell enables the priest to converse with any type of creature that has any form of communicative ability (including empathic; tactile; pheromonic; etc.). That is; the monster understands; in its own language or equivalent; the intent of what is said to it by the priest and vice versa. The creature thus spoken to is checked by the DM to determine a reaction. All creatures of the same type as that chosen by the priest can likewise understand if they are within range. The priest can speak to different types of creatures during the spell duration; but he must speak separately to each type. The spell lasts for two rounds per caster level. 
6,Stone Tell,Divination,Elemental (Earth); Divination,Touch,VSM,1 turn,1 turn,1 cu. yd.,None,When the priest casts a stone tell spell upon an area; the very stones speak and relate to the caster who or what has touched them as well as revealing what is covered; concealed; or simply behind them. The stones relate complete descriptions; if asked. Note that a stone's perspective; perception; and knowledge may hinder this divination. Such details; if any; are decided by the DM. The material components for this spell are a drop of mercury and a bit of clay. 
6,Transmute Water to Dust,Alteration,Elemental (Water; Earth),60 yds.,VSM,Permanent,8,1 cu. yd./level,Special,Reversible. When this spell is cast; the subject area instantly undergoes a change from liquid to powdery dust. Note that if the water is already muddy; the area of effect is doubled; while if wet mud is present; the area of effect is quadrupled. If water remains in contact with the transmuted dust; the former quickly permeates the latter; turning the dust into silty mud. If there is not a sufficient quantity of water to cause that effect; it simply soaks or dampens the dust accordingly. Only the liquid actually in the area of effect at the moment of spellcasting is affected. Potions that contain water as a component part are rendered useless. Living creatures are unaffected; except for those native to the elemental plane of Water. Such creatures must roll a successful saving throws vs. death or be slain. However; only one such creature can be affected by any single casting of this spell; regardless of the creature's size or the size of the spell's area of effect. The reverse of this spell is simply a very high-powered create water spell that requires a pinch of normal dust as an additional material component. For either usage of the spell; other components required are diamond dust of at least 500 gp value; a bit of sea shell; and the caster's holy symbol. 
6,Transport Via Plants,Alteration,Plant,Touch,VS,Special,4,Special,None,By means of this spell; the caster is able to enter any plant (human-sized or larger) and pass any distance to a plant of the same species in a single round; regardless of the distance separating the two. The entry plant must be alive. The destination plant need not be familiar to the caster; but it also must be alive. If the caster is uncertain of the destination plant; he need merely determine direction and distance; and the transport via plants spell moves him as close as possible to the desired location. There is a 20% chance; reduced by 1% per level of experience of the caster; that the transport delivers the caster to a similar species of plant from 1 to 100 miles away from the desired destination plant. If a particular destination plant is desired; but the plant is not living; the spell fails and the caster must come forth from the entrance plant within 24 hours. Note that this spell does not function with plantlike creatures such as shambling mounds; treants; etc. The destruction of an occupied plant slays the caster (see the plant door spell). 
6,Turn Wood,Alteration,Plant,0,VS,1 rd./level,9,20 ft./level x 120 ft.,None,When this spell is cast; waves of force roll forth from the caster; moving in the direction he faces and causing all wooden objects in the path of the spell to be pushed away from the caster to the limit of the area of effect. Wooden objects above 3 inches in diameter that are fixed firmly are not affected; but loose objects (movable mantles; siege towers; etc.) move back. Objects less than 3 inches in diameter that are fixed splinter and break; and the pieces move with the wave of force. Thus; objects such as wooden shields; spears; wooden weapon shafts and hafts; and arrows and bolts are pushed back; dragging those carrying them with them. If a spear is planted to prevent this forced movement; it splinters. Even magical items with wooden sections are turned; although an anti-magic shell blocks the effects. A successful dispel magic spell ends the effect. Otherwise; the turn wood spell lasts for one round for each experience level of the caster. The waves of force continue to sweep down the set path for the spell's duration; pushing back wooden objects in the area of effect at a rate of 40 feet per melee round. The length of the path is 20 feet per level of the caster. Thus if a 14th-level priest casts a turn wood spell; the area of effect is 120 feet wide by 280 feet long; and the spell lasts 14 rounds. After casting the spell; the path is set and the caster can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell's power. 
6,Wall of Thorns,Conjuration/Summoning,Plant; Creation,80 yds.,VS,1 turn/level,9,One 10-ft. cube/level,None,The wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of very tough; pliable; tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a person's finger. Any creature breaking through (or crashing into) the wall of thorns suffers 8 points of damage; plus an additional amount of damage equal to the creature's AC. Negative ACs subtract from the base 8 points of damage; but no adjustment is made for Dexterity. Any creature within the area of effect of the spell when it is cast; crashes into the wall of thorns and must break through to move. The damage is based on each 10-foot thickness of the barrier. If the wall of thorns is chopped at; it takes at least four turns to cut a path through a 10- foot thickness. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier; but magical fires burn away the barrier in two turns; creating a wall of fire effect while doing so (see wall of fire spell). In this case; the cool side of the wall is that closest to the caster of the thorn wall. The nearest edge of the wall of thorns appears up to 80 yards distant from the caster; as he desires. The spell's duration is one turn for each level of experience of the caster; and it covers one 10-foot cube per level of the caster in whatever shape the caster desires. Thus a 14th-level caster could create a wall of thorns up to 70 feet long by 20 feet high (or deep) by 10 feet deep (or high); a 10-foot-high by 10-foot-wide by 140-foot-long wall to block a dungeon passage; or any other sort of shape that suited his needs. The caster can also create a wall of 5-foot thickness; which inflicts half damage but can be doubled in one of the other dimensions. Note that those with the ability to pass through overgrown areas are not hindered by this barrier. The caster can dismiss the barrier on command. 
6,Weather Summoning,Conjuration/Summoning,Weather,0,VS,Special,1 turn,Special,None,By this spell; the caster calls forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area he is in. Thus; in spring a tornado; thunderstorm; sleet storm; or hot weather could be summoned. In summer a torrential rain; heat wave; hail storm; etc.; can be called for. In autumn; hot or cold weather; fog; sleet; etc.; could be summoned. Winter enables great cold; blizzard; or thaw conditions to be summoned. Hurricane-force winds can be summoned near coastal regions in the later winter or early spring. The summoned weather is not under the control of the caster. It might last but a single turn; in the case of a tornado; or for hours or even days in other cases. The area of effect likewise varies from about 1 square mile to 100 square miles. Note that several casters can act in concert to greatly affect weather; controlling winds; and working jointly to summon very extreme weather conditions. Within four turns after the spell is cast; the trend of the weather to come is apparent-- e.g.; clearing skies; gusts of warm or hot air; a chill breeze; overcast skies; etc. Summoned weather arrives 1d12+5 turns after the spell is cast. Note that the new weather condition cannot be changed by the caster once it has been summoned. Once the weather is fully summoned; it cannot be dispelled. If the summoning is successfully dispelled before it has been completed; the weather slowly reverts to its original condition. 
6,Word of Recall ,Alteration,Summoning,0,V,Special,1,The caster,None,The word of recall spell takes the priest instantly back to his sanctuary when the word is uttered. The sanctuary must be specifically designated in advance by the priest and must be a well-known place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10' x 10'. The priest can be transported any distance; from above or below ground. Transportation by the word of recall spell is safe within a plane; but for each plane the priest is removed; there is a 10% cumulative chance that the priest is irrevocably lost. The priest is able to transport; in addition to himself; 25 pounds of weight per experience level. Thus; a 15th-level priest could transport his person and an additional 375 pounds. This extra matter can be equipment; treasure; or even living material; such as another person. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail. Note that unusually strong physical fields; such as magnetic or gravitational forces; or even magical applications can; at the DM's option; make the use of this spell hazardous or impossible. 
7,Animate Rock,Alteration,Elemental (Earth),40 yds.,VSM,1 rd./level,1 rd.,2 cu. ft./level,None,By employing an animate rock spell; the caster causes a stone object of up to the indicated size to move (see the 6th-level animate object spell.). The animated stone object must be separate (not a part of a huge boulder or the like). It follows the desire of the caster--attacking; breaking objects; blocking--while the magic lasts. It has no intelligence or volition of its own; but it follows instructions exactly as spoken. Only one set of instructions for one single action can be given to the animated rock; and the directions must be brief; about a dozen words or so. The rock remains animated for one round per experience level of the caster. The volume of rock that can be animated is also based on the experience level of the caster--2 cubic feet of stone per level; such as 24 cubic feet; a mass of about man-sized; at 12th level. While the exact details of the animated rock are decided by the DM; its Armor Class is no worse than 5; and it has 1d3 hit points per cubic foot of volume. It uses the attack roll of the caster. The maximum damage it can inflict is 1d2 points per caster level. Thus; a 12th-level caster's rock might inflict 12 to 24 points of damage. Movement for a man- sized rock is 60 feet per round. A rock generally weighs from 100 to 300 pounds per cubic foot. The material components for the spell are a stone and drop of the caster's blood. 
7,Astral Spell,Alteration,Astral,Touch,VS,Special,1/2 hour,Special,None,By means of this spell; a priest is able to project his astral body into the Astral plane; leaving his physical body and material possessions behind on the Prime Material plane. As the Astral plane touches upon the first levels of all the outer planes; the priest can travel astrally to the first level of any of these outer planes as he wills. The priest then leaves the Astral plane; forming a body on the plane of existence he has chosen to enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material plane by means of the astral spell. However; a second body cannot be formed on the Prime Material plane. As a general rule; a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures on the Astral plane. The astral body is connected at all times to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken; the affected person is killed; astrally and materially; but generally only the psychic wind can cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed on a different plane; the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or astral form is slain; the cord simply returns to the caster's body where the body rests on the Prime Material plane; reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral plane; their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes. The spell lasts until the priest desires to end it; or until it is terminated by some outside means; such as dispel magic spell or destruction of the priest's body on the Prime Material plane--which kills the priest. The priest can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with himself by means of the astral spell; providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the priest. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the priest and can be stranded if something happens to the priest. Travel in the Astral plane can be slow or fast; according to the priest's desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the desire of the priest. 
7,Changestaff,Evocation; Enchantment,Plant; Creation,Touch,VSM,Special,4,The caster's staff,None,By means of this spell; the caster is able to change a specially prepared staff into a treantlike creature of the largest size; about 24 feet tall. When the priest plants the end of the staff in the ground and speaks a special command and invocation; the staff turns into a treantlike creature with 12 Hit Dice; 40 hit points; and Armor Class 0. It attacks twice per round; inflicting 4d6 points of damage with every successful attack. The staff-treant defends the caster and obeys any spoken commands. However; it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. The transformation lasts either for as many turns as the caster has experience levels; until the caster commands the staff to return to its true form; or until the staff is destroyed; whichever occurs first. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 hit points or less; it crumbles to a sawdustlike powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise; the staff can be used again after 24 hours and the staff- treant is at full strength. To cast a changestaff spell; the caster must have either his holy symbol or leaves (ash; oak; or yew) of the same sort as the staff. The staff for the changestaff spell must be specially prepared. The staff must be a sound limb cut from an ash; oak; or yew tree struck by lightning no more than 24 hours before the limb is cut. The limb must then be cured by sun drying and special smoke for 28 days. Then it must be shaped; carved; and polished for another 28 days. The caster cannot adventure or engage in other strenuous activity during either of these periods. The finished staff; engraved with woodland scenes; is then rubbed with the juice of holly berries; and the end of it is thrust into the earth of the caster's grove while he casts a speak with plant spell; calling upon the staff to assist in time of need. The item is then charged with a magic that will last for many changes from staff to treant and back again. 
7,Chariot of Sustarre,Evocation,Elemental (Fire); Creation,10 yds.,VSM,12 hours,1 turn,Special,None,When this spell is cast; it brings forth a large; flaming chariot pulled by two fiery horses from the elemental plane of Fire. These appear in a clap of thunder amid a cloud of smoke. The vehicle moves at 24 on the ground; 48 flying; and can carry the caster and up to seven other creatures of man-size or less. The passengers must be touched by the caster to protect them from the flames of the chariot. Creatures other than the caster and his designated passengers sustain 2d4 points of fire damage each round if they come within 5 feet of the horses or chariot. Such creatures suffer no damage if they evade the area by rolling successful saving throws vs. petrification; with Dexterity adjustments. The caster controls the chariot by verbal command; causing the flaming steeds to stop or go; walk; trot; run or fly; and turn left or right as he desires. Note that the chariot of Sustarre is a physical manifestation and can sustain damage. The vehicle and steeds are struck only by magical weapons or by water (one quart of which inflicts 1 point of damage). They are Armor Class 2; and each requires 30 points of damage to dispel. Naturally; fire has no effect upon either the vehicle or its steeds; but magical fires other than those of the chariot can affect the riders. Other spells; such as a successful dispel magic or holy word; will force the chariot back to its home plane; without its passengers. The chariot can be summoned only once per week. The material components are a small piece of wood; two holly berries; and a fire source at least equal to a torch. 
7,Confusion,Enchantment/Charm,Charm,80 yds.,VSM,1 rd./level,1 rd.,1d4 creatures in 40-ft. sq.,Special,"This spell causes confusion in one or more creatures within the area; creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. The spell affects 1d4 creatures; plus one creature per two caster levels. Thus; seven to ten creatures can be affected by a 12th- or 13th-level caster; eight to 11 by a 14th- or 15th-level caster; etc. These creatures are allowed saving throws vs. spell with -2 penalties; adjusted for Wisdom. Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. Confused creatures react as follows (roll 1d10) -- (d10 / Reaction): (1 / Wander away (unless prevented) for duration of spell 2-6 Stand confused one round (then roll again)); (7-9 / Attack nearest creature for one round (then roll again)); (10 / Act normally for one round (then roll again)). The spell lasts one round for each level of the caster. Those who fail their saving throws are checked by the DM for actions each round; for the duration of the spell; or until the ""wander away for the duration of the spell"" result occurs. Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible in their most typical mode of movement (characters walk; fish swim; bats fly; etc.). This is not panicked flight. Wandering creatures also have a 50% chance of using any special innate movement abilities (plane shift; burrowing; flight; etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature. The material component of this spell is a set of three nut shells. Note: If there are many creatures involved; the DM may decide to assume average results. For example; if there are 16 orcs affected and 25% could be expected to successfully roll the saving throw; then four are assumed to have succeeded; one wanders away; four attack the nearest creature; six stand confused and the last acts normally but must check next round. Since the orcs are not near the party; the DM decides that two who are supposed to attack the nearest creature attack each other; one attacks an orc that saved; and one attacks a confused orc; which strikes back. The next round; the base is 11 orcs; since four originally saved and one wandered off. Another one wanders off; five stands confused; four attack; and one acts normally. "
7,Conjure Earth Elemental,Conjuration/Summoning,Elemental (Earth); Summoning,40 yds.,VS,1 turn/level,1 turn,Special,None,Reversible. A caster who performs a conjure earth elemental spell summons an earth elemental to do his bidding. The elemental is 60% likely to have 12 Hit Dice; 35% likely to have 16 Hit Dice; and 5% likely have 21 to 24 Hit Dice (20 + 1d4). Further; the caster needs but to command it; and it does as desired. The elemental regards the caster as a friend to be obeyed. The elemental remains until destroyed; dispelled; sent away by dismissal or a holy word spell (see the conjure fire elemental spell); or the spell duration expires. 
7,Control Weather,Alteration,Weather,0,VSM,4d12 hours,1 turn,4d4 sq. miles,None,The control weather spell enables a priest to change the weather in the local area. The spell affects the weather for 4d12 hours in an area of 4d4 square miles. It requires one turn to cast the spell; and an additional 1d4 turns for the weather conditions to occur. The current weather conditions are decided by the DM; depending on the climate and season. Weather conditions have three components: precipitation; temperature; and wind. The spell can change these conditions according to the following chart. The upper-cased headings represent the existing weather conditions. The small headings beneath each large heading are the new conditions to which the caster can change the existing conditions. Furthermore; the caster can control the direction of the wind. For example; a day that is clear and warm with moderate wind can be controlled to become hazy; hot; and calm. Contradictions are not possible--fog and strong wind; for example. Multiple control weather spells can be used only in succession. (Condition / Existing / Can Change To:): (Precipitation / CLEAR WEATHER / Very clear or Light clouds or Hazy); (Precipitation / PARTLY CLOUDY / Clear weather or Cloudy or Mist/light rain/small hail or Sleet/light snow); (Precipitation / CLOUDY / Partly cloudy or Deep clouds or Fog or Heavy rain/large hail or Driving sleet/heavy snow); (Temperature / HOT / Sweltering heat or Warm); (Temperature / WARM / Hot or Cool); (Temperature / COOL / Warm or Cold); (Temperature / COLD / Cool or Arctic cold); (Wind / CALM / Dead calm or Light wind or Moderate wind); (Wind / MODERATE WIND / Calm or Strong wind); (Wind / STRONG WIND / Moderate wind or Gale); (Wind / GALE / String wind or Storm); (Wind / STORM / Gale or Hurricane-typhoon). The material components for this spell are the priest's religious symbol; incense; and prayer beads or similar prayer object. Obviously; the spell functions only in areas where there are appropriate climatic conditions. If Weather is a major sphere for the priest (as it is for druids); duration and area are doubled; and the caster can change the prevailing weather by two places. For example; he can cause precipitation to go from partly cloudy to heavy sleet; temperature to go from cool to arctic; and wind to go from calm to strong. 
7,Creeping Doom,Conjuration/Summoning,Animal; Summoning,0,VS,4 rds./level,1 rd.,Special,None,When the caster utters the spell of creeping doom; he calls forth a mass of from 500 to 1;000 ([1d6 + 4] x 100) venomous; biting and stinging arachnids; insects; and myriapods. This carpetlike mass swarms in an area 20 feet square. Upon command from the caster; the swarm creeps forth at 10 feet per round toward any prey within 80 yards; moving in the direction in which the caster commands. The creeping doom slays any creature subject to normal attacks; as each of the small horrors inflicts 1 point of damage (each then dies after its attack); so that up to 1;000 points of damage can be inflicted on creatures within the path of the creeping doom. If the creeping doom travels more than 80 yards away from the summoner; it loses 50 of its number for each 10 yards beyond 80 yards. For example; at 100 yards; its number has shrunk by 100. There are a number of ways to thwart or destroy the creatures forming the swarm. The solutions are left to the imaginations of players and DMs. 
7,Earthquake ,Alteration,Elemental (Earth),120 yds.,VSM,1 rd.,1 turn,5-ft. diameter/level,None,When this spell is cast by a priest; a local tremor of fairly high strength rips the ground. The shock is over in one round. The earthquake affects all terrain; vegetation; structures; and creatures in its area of effect. The area of effect of the earthquake spell is circular; with a diameter of 5 feet for every experience level of the priest casting it. Thus a 20th- level priest casts an earthquake spell with a 100-foot-diameter area of effect. Solidly built structures with foundations reaching down to bedrock sustain one-half damage; one-quarter damage if they score above 50% on a saving throw. An earth elemental opposed to the caster in the area of effect can negate 10% to 100% (roll 1d10; 0 = 100%) of the effect. Other magical protections and wards allowed by the DM may also reduce or negate this effect. If cast undersea; this spell may; at the discretion of the DM; create a tsunami or tidal wave. The material components for this spell are a pinch of dirt; a piece of rock; and a lump of clay. Earthquake Effects -- TERRAIN: Cave or cavern--Collapses roof; Cliffs--Crumble; causing landslide; Ground--Cracks open; causing the following fractions of creatures to fall in and die: Size S: 1 in 4 / Size M: 1 in 6 / Size L: 1 in 8; Marsh--Drains water to form muddy; rough ground; Tunnel--Caves in. VEGETATION: Small growth--No effect; Trees--1 in 3 are uprooted and fall. STRUCTURES: All structures--Sustain 5d12 points of structural damage; those suffering full damage are thrown down in rubble. CREATURES (See TERRAIN entry) 
7,Exaction ,Evocation; Alteration,Charm; Summoning,10 yds.,VSM,Special,1 rd.,1 creature,None,When this spell is employed; the priest confronts some powerful creature from another plane (including devas and other powerful minions; for instance; but not demigods or deities of any sort) and requires of it some duty or quest. A creature of an alignment opposed to the priest (e.g.; evil if the priest is good; chaotic if the priest is lawful) cannot be ordered around unless it is willing. Note that an absolute (true) neutral creature is effectively opposed to both good and evil; and both law and chaos. The spellcaster must know something about the creature to exact service from it; or else he must offer some fair trade in return for the service. That is; if the priest is aware that the creature has received some favor from someone of the priest's alignment; then the exaction spell can name this as cause. If no balancing reason for service is known; then some valuable gift or service must be pledged in return for the exaction. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the past or promised favor or reward; and with the being's effort and risk. The spell then acts; subject to a magic resistance roll; as a quest upon the being that is to perform the required service. Immediately upon completion of the service; the being is transported to the vicinity of the priest; and the priest must then and there return the promised reward; whether it is irrevocable cancellation of a past debt or the giving of some service or other material reward. After this is done; the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane. The DM adjudicates when an equitable arrangement has been reached. If the caster requests too much; the creature is free to depart or to attack the priest (as if the agreement were breached) according to its nature. If circumstances leave the situation unbalanced (for example; the creature dies while achieving a result that was not worth dying for); then this might create a debt owed by the caster to the creature's surviving kith and kin; making the caster vulnerable to a future exaction spell from that quarter. Agreeing to a future exaction or release in the event of catastrophic failure or death are common caster pledges in securing an exaction.Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in the priest being subject to exaction by the subject creature or by its master; liege; etc.; at the very least. At worst; the creature can attack the reneging priest without fear of any of his spells affecting it; for the priest's failure to live up to the bargain gives the creature immunity from the priest's spell powers. The material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol; some matter or substance from the plane of the creature from whom an exaction is expected; and knowledge of the creature's nature or actions that is written out on a parchment that is burned to seal the pledge. 
7,Fire Storm ,Evocation,Elemental (Fire),160 yds.,VS,1 rd.,1 rd.,two 10-ft. cubes/level,2-Jan,Reversible. When a fire storm spell is cast; the whole area is shot through with sheets of roaring flame that equal a wall of fire spell in effect. Creatures within the area of fire and 10 feet or less from the edge of the affected area receive 2d8 points of damage plus additional damage equal to the caster's level (2d8 +1/level). Creatures that roll successful saving throws vs. spell suffer only one-half damage. The damage is inflicted each round the creature stays in the area of effect. The area of effect is equal to two 10-foot x 10-foot cubes per level of the cater--e.g.; a 13th-level caster can cast a fire storm measuring 130 feet x 20 feet x 10 feet. The height of the storm is 10 or 20 feet; the imbalance of its area must be in length and width. The reverse spell; fire quench; smothers twice the area of effect of a fire storm spell with respect to normal fires; and the normal area of effect with respect to magical fires. Fire-based creatures; such as elementals; salamanders; etc.; of less than demigod status have a 5% chance per experience level of the caster of being extinguished. If cast only against a flametongue sword; the sword must roll a successful saving throw vs. crushing blow or be rendered nonmagical. Such a sword in the possession of a creature first receives the creature's saving throw; and if this is successful; the second saving throw is automatically successful. 
7,Gate ,Conjuration/Summoning,Summoning,30 yds.,VS,Special,5,Special,None,Casting a gate spell has two effects: it causes an interdimensional connection between the plane of existence the priest is in and the plane in which dwells a specific being of great power. The result of this connection is that the sought-after being can step through the gate or portal; from its plane to that of the priest. Uttering the spell attracts the attention of the dweller on the other plane. When casting the spell; the priest must name the entity he desires to make use of the gate and to come to his aid. There is a 100% chance that something steps through the gate. The actions of the being that comes through depend on many factors; including the alignment of the priest; the nature of those accompanying him; and who or what opposes or threatens the priest. The DM will decide the exact result of the spell; based on the creature called; the desires of the caster and the needs of the moment. The being gates in either returns immediately or remains to take action. Casting this spell ages the priest five years. 
7,Holy Word,Conjuration/Summoning,Combat,0,V,Special,1,30-ft. radius,None,Reversible. Uttering a holy word spell creates magic of tremendous power. It drives off evil creatures from other planes; forcing them to return to their own planes of existence; provided the speaker is in his home plane. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least a day. The spell further affects creatures of differing alignment as shown on the following table -- Effects of Holy Word: (Creature's Hit Dice or Level / General / Attack Move / Attack Dice / Spells): (Less than 4 / Kills / -- / -- / —); (4 to 7+ / Paralyzes 1d4 turns / -- / -- / --); (8 to 11+ / Slows 2d4 rounds / -50% / -4* / --); (12 or more / Deafens 1d4 rounds / -25% / -2 / 50% chance of failure). * Slowed creatures attack only on even-numbered rounds until the effect wears off. Affected creatures are those within the 30-foot-radius area of effect; which is centered on the priest casting the spell. The side effects are negated for deafened or silenced creatures; but such are still driven off if other-planar. The reverse; unholy word; operates exactly the same way but affects creatures of good alignment. 
7,Regenerate,Necrmancy,Necromantic,Touch,VSM,Permanent,3 rounds,Creature touched,None,Reversible. When a regenerate spell is cast; body members (fingers; toes; hands; feet; arms; legs; tails; or even heads of multi-headed creatues); bones; and organs grow back. The process of regeneration requies but one round if the severed member(s) is (are) present and touching the creature; 2d4turns otherwise. The creature must be lving to receive the benefits of this spell. If the severed member is not present; or if the injury isolder than ond day per caste level; the recipient must roll a successful system shock check to survive the spell. The reverse; wither; causes the member or organ touched to cease functioning in one round; dropping off into dust in 2d4 turns. Creatures must be touched for the harmful effect to occur. The material components of this spell are a prayer device and holy water (or unholy water for the reverse). 
7,Reincarnate,Necromancy,Necromantic,Touch,VS,Permanent,1 turn,1 person,None,With this spell; the priest can bring back a dead person in another body; if death occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell. Reincarnation does not require any saving throw; system shock; or resurrection survival roll. The corpse is touched; and a new incarnation of the person appears in the area in 1d6 turns. The person reincarnated recalls the majority of his former life and form; but the character class; if any; of the new incarnation might be very different indeed. The new incarnation is determined on the following table or by DM choice. If a player character race is indicated; the character must be created. At the DM's option; certain special (expensive) incenses can be used that may increase the chance for a character to return as a specific race or species. A wish spell can restore a reincarnated character to its original form and status. (D100 Roll / Incarnation): (01-03 / Badger); (04-08 / Bear; black); (09-12 / Bear; brown); (13-16 / Boar; wild); (17-19 / Centaur); (20-23 / Dryad); (24-28 / Eagle); (29-31 / Elf); (32-34 / Faun or satyr); (35-36 / Fox); (37-40 / Gnome); (41-44 / Hawk); (45-58 / Human); (59-61 / Lynx); (62-64 / Owl); (65-68 / Pixie); (69-70 / Raccoon); (71-75 / Stag); (76-80 / Wolf); (81-85 / Wolverine); (86-00 / DM's choice). If an unusual creature form is indicated; the DM can (at his option only) use the guidelines for new player character races to allow the character to earn experience and advance in levels; although this may not be in the same class as before. If the reincarnated character returns as a creature eligible to be the same class as he was previously (i.e.; a human fighter returns as an elf); the reincarnated character has half his previous levels and hit points. If the character returns as a new character class; his hit points are half his previous total; but he must begin again at 1st level. If the character returns as a creature unable to have a class; he has half the hit points and saving throws of his previous incarnation. 
7,Restoration,Necromancy,Necromantic,Touch,VS,Permanent,3 rds.,1 creature,None,Reversible. When this spell is cast; the life energy level of the recipient creature is raised by one. This reverses any previous life energy level drain of the creature by a force or monster. Thus; if a 10th-level character had been struck by a wight and drained to 9th level; the restoration spell would bring the character up to exactly the number of experience points necessary to restore him to 10th level once again; restoring additional Hit Dice (or hit points) and level functions accordingly. Restoration is effective only if the spell is cast within one day of the recipient's loss of life energy; per experience level of the priest casting it. A restoration spell restores the intelligence of a creature affected by a feeblemind spell. It also negates all forms of insanity. Casting this spell ages both the caster and the recipient by two years. The reverse; energy drain; draws away one life energy level (see such undead as spectre; wight; and vampire; in the Monstrous Manual). The energy drain requires the victim to be touched. Casting this form of the spell does not age the caster. 
7,Resurrection,Necromancy,Necromantic,Touch,VSM,Permanent,1 turn,1 creature,None,Reversible. The priest is able to restore life and complete strength to any living creature; including elves; by bestowing the resurrection spell. The creature can have been dead up to 10 years per level of the priest casting the spell. Thus; a 19th-level priest can resurrect the bones of a creature dead up to 190 years. The creature; upon surviving a resurrection survival check; is immediately restored to full hit points and can perform strenuous activity. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has reached its allotted life span (i.e.; died of natural causes). Casting this spell makes it impossible for the priest to cast further spells or engage in combat until he has had one day of bed rest for each experience level or Hit Die of the creature brought back to life. The caster ages three years upon casting this spell. The reverse; destruction; causes the victim of the spell to be instantly dead and turned to dust. A wish spell or equivalent is required for recovery. Destruction requires a touch; either in combat or otherwise; and does not age the caster. In addition; the victim is allowed a saving throw (with a -4 penalty). If the save is successful; the victim receives 8d6 points of damage instead. The material components of the spell are the priest's religious symbol and holy water (unholy water for the reverse spell). The DM may reduce the chances of successful resurrection if little of the creature's remains are available. 
7,Succor,Alteration; Enchantment,Summoning,Touch,VSM,Special,1 day,1 person,None,Reversible. By casting this spell; the priest creates a powerful magic aura in some specially prepared object--a string of prayer beads; a small clay tablet; an ivory baton; etc. This object radiates magic; for it contains the power to instantaneously transport its possessor to the sanctuary of the priest who created its magic. Once the item is enchanted; the priest must give it willingly to an individual; at the same time informing him of a command word to be spoken when the item is to be used. To make use of the item; the recipient must speak the command word at the same time that he rends or breaks the item. When this is done; the individual and all that he is wearing and carrying (up to the maximum encumbrance limit for the character) are instantly transported to the sanctuary of the priest; just as if the individual were capable of speaking a word of recall spell. No other creatures can be affected. The reversed application of the spell causes the priest to be transported to the immediate vicinity of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word said. The priest has a general idea of the location and situation of the item's possessor; and can choose not to be affected by this summons. This decision is made at the instant when the transportation is to take place. However; if he chooses not to go; the opportunity is gone forever and the spell is wasted. The cost of preparing the special item (for either version of the spell) varies from 2;000 to 5;000 gp. The more costly items can transport the subject from one plane of existence to another; if the DM allows. Note that the same factors that can prevent the operation of the plane shift and teleport spells can also prevent the use of this spell. 
7,Sunray,Evocation; Alteration,Sun,10 yds./level,VSM,1+1d4 rds.,4,5-ft. radius (special),Special,With this spell; the caster can evoke a dazzling beam of light each round in which no action other than movement is performed. The sunray is like a ray of natural sunlight. All creatures in the 10-foot-diameter area of effect must roll successful saving throws vs. spell or be blinded for 1d3 rounds; those using infravision at the time for 2d4 rounds. Creatures to whom sunlight is harmful or unnatural suffer permanent blindness if the saving throw is failed; and are blinded for 2d6 rounds if the saving throw is successful. Those within its area of effect; as well as creatures within 20 feet of its perimeter; lose any infravision capabilities for 1d4+1 rounds. Undead caught within the sunray's area of effect receive 8d6 points of damage; one- half if a saving throw vs. spell is successful. Those undead 20 feet to either side of the sunray's area of effect receive 3d6 points of damage; no damage if a save is successful. In addition; the ray may result in the total destruction of those undead specifically affected by sunlight; if their saving throws are failed. The ultraviolet light generated by the spell inflicts damage on fungoid creatures and subterranean fungi just as if they were undead; but no saving throw is allowed.The material components are an aster seed and a piece of adventuring feldspar (sunstone). 
7,Symbol,Conjuration/Summoning,Guardian,Touch,VSM,1 turn/level,3,60 ft. radius,Neg.,The priest casting this spell inscribes a glowing symbol in the air upon any surface; according to his desire. Any creature looking at the completed symbol within 60 feet must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or suffer the effect. The symbol glows for one turn for each experience level of the caster. The particular symbol used is selected by the caster at the time of casting. The caster will not be affected by his own symbol. One of the following effects is chosen by the caster: Hopelessness: Creatures seeing it must turn back in dejection or surrender to capture or attack unless they roll successful saving throws vs. spell. Its effects last for 3d4 turns. Pain: Creatures affected suffer -4 penalties to their attack rolls and -2 penalties to their Dexterity ability scores due to wracking pains. The effects last for 2d10 turns. Persuasion: Creatures seeing the symbol become of the same alignment as and friendly to the priest who scribed the symbol for 1d20 turns unless a saving throw vs. spell is successful. The material components of this spell are mercury and phosphorous (see 8th-level wizard spell; symbol). 
7,Transmute Metal to Wood,Alteration,Elemental (Earth),80 yds.,VSM,Permanent,1 rd.,1 metal object,Special,The transmute metal to wood spell enables the caster to change an object from metal to wood. The volume of metal cannot exceed a maximum weight of 10 pounds per experience level of the priest. Magical objects made of metal are 90% resistant to the spell; and those on the person of a creature receive the creature's saving throw as well. Artifacts and relics cannot be transmuted. Note that only a wish spell or similar magic can restore a transmuted object to its metallic state. Otherwise; for example; a metal door changed to wood would be forevermore a wooden door. 
7,Wind Walk ,Alteration,Elemental (Air),Touch,VSM,1 hour/level,1 rd.,Caster + 1 person/8 levels,None,This spell enables the priest (and possibly one or two other persons) to alter the substance of his body to a cloudlike vapor. A magical wind then wafts the priest along at a movement rate of 60; or as slow as 6; as the spellcaster wills. The wind walk spell lasts as long as the priest desires; up to a maximum duration of six turns (one hour) per experience level of the caster. For every eight levels of experience the priest has attained; up to 24; he is able to touch another person and carry that person; or those persons; along on the wind walk. Persons wind walking are not invisible; but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white; they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds; fog; vapors; etc. The priest can regain his physical form as desired; each change to and from vaporous form requiring five rounds. While in vaporous form; the priest and companions are hit only by magic or magical weaponry; though they may be subject to high winds at the DM's discretion. No spellcasting is possible in vaporous form. The material components of this spell are fire and holy water.
